24–1The energy of an oscillator
Although this chapter is entitled “transients,” certain
parts of it are, in a way, part of the last chapter on forced
oscillation. One of the features of a forced oscillation which we have
not yet discussed is the energy in the oscillation. Let us now
consider that energy.
In a mechanical oscillator, how much kinetic energy is there? It is
proportional to the square of the velocity. Now we come to an
important point. Consider an arbitrary quantity AA, which may be the
velocity or something else that we want to discuss. When we write A=A^eiωtA=A^eiωt, a complex number, the true and honest AA, in
the physical world, is only the real part; therefore if, for
some reason, we want to use the square of AA, it is not right
to square the complex number and then take the real part, because the
real part of the square of a complex number is not just the square of
the real part, but also involves the imaginary part. So when we
wish to find the energy we have to get away from the complex notation
for a while to see what the inner workings are.
Now the true physical AA is the real part of A0ei(ωt+Δ)A0ei(ωt+Δ), that is, A=A0cos(ωt+Δ)A=A0cos(ωt+Δ), where
A^A^, the complex number, is written as A0eiΔA0eiΔ. Now the
square of this real physical quantity is A2=A20cos2(ωt+Δ)A2=A02cos2(ωt+Δ). The square of the quantity, then, goes up and down from
a maximum to zero, like the square of the cosine. The square of the
cosine has a maximum of 11 and a minimum of 00, and its average
value is 1/21/2.
In many circumstances we are not interested in the energy at any
specific moment during the oscillation; for a large number of
applications we merely want the average of A2A2, the mean of
the square of AA over a period of time large compared with the period
of oscillation. In those circumstances, the average of the cosine
squared may be used, so we have the following theorem: if AA is
represented by a complex number, then the mean of A2A2 is equal
to 12A2012A02. Now A20A02 is the square of the magnitude of the
complex A^A^. (This can be written in many ways—some people
like to write |A^|2|A^|2; others write, A^A^∗A^A^∗,
A^A^ times its complex conjugate.)
We shall use this theorem
several times.
Now let us consider the energy in a forced oscillator. The equation
for the forced oscillator is
md2x/dt2+γmdx/dt+mω20x=F(t).(24.1)(24.1)md2x/dt2+γmdx/dt+mω02x=F(t).
In our problem, of course, F(t)F(t) is a cosine function of tt. Now let
us analyze the situation: how much work is done by the outside
force FF?
The work done by the force per second, i.e., the power, is the
force times the velocity. (We know that the differential work in a
time dtdt is FdxFdx, and the power is Fdx/dtFdx/dt.) Thus
P=F=mdxdt[(dxdt)(d2xdt2)+ω20x(dxdt)]+γm(dxdt)2.(24.2)P=Fdxdt=m[(dxdt)(d2xdt2)+ω02x(dxdt)](24.2)+γm(dxdt)2.
But the first two terms on the right can also be written as
d/dt[12m(dx/dt)2+12mω20x2]d/dt[12m(dx/dt)2+12mω02x2], as is
immediately verified by differentiating. That is to say, the term in
brackets is a pure derivative of two terms that are easy to
understand—one is the kinetic energy of motion, and the other is the
potential energy of the spring. Let us call this quantity the
stored energy, that is, the energy stored in the
oscillation. Suppose that we want the average power over many cycles
when the oscillator is being forced and has been running for a long
time. In the long run, the stored energy does not change—its
derivative gives zero average effect. In other words, if we average
the power in the long run, all the energy ultimately ends up in
the resistive term γm(dx/dt)2γm(dx/dt)2. There is some energy
stored in the oscillation, but that does not change with time, if we
average over many cycles. Therefore the mean power ⟨P⟩⟨P⟩ is
⟨P⟩=⟨γm(dx/dt)2⟩.(24.3)(24.3)⟨P⟩=⟨γm(dx/dt)2⟩.
Using our method of writing complex numbers, and our theorem that
⟨A2⟩=12A20⟨A2⟩=12A02, we may find this mean power. Thus if x=x^eiωtx=x^eiωt, then dx/dt=iωx^eiωtdx/dt=iωx^eiωt. Therefore, in these circumstances, the average power could be
written as
⟨P⟩=12γmω2x20.(24.4)(24.4)⟨P⟩=12γmω2x02.
In the notation for electrical circuits, dx/dtdx/dt is replaced by the
current II (II is dq/dtdq/dt, where qq corresponds to xx), and
mγmγ corresponds to the resistance RR. Thus the rate of the
energy loss—the power used up by the forcing function—is the
resistance in the circuit times the average square of the current:
⟨P⟩=R⟨I2⟩=R⋅12I20.(24.5)(24.5)⟨P⟩=R⟨I2⟩=R⋅12I02.
This energy, of course, goes into heating the resistor; it is
sometimes called the heating loss or the Joule heating.
Another interesting feature to discuss is how much energy is
stored. That is not the same as the power, because although
power was at first used to store up some energy, after that the system
keeps on absorbing power, insofar as there are any heating (resistive)
losses. At any moment there is a certain amount of stored energy, so
we would like to calculate the mean stored energy ⟨E⟩⟨E⟩ also. We
have already calculated what the average of (dx/dt)2(dx/dt)2 is, so we find
⟨E⟩=12m⟨(dx/dt)2⟩+12mω20⟨x2⟩=12m(ω2+ω20)12x20.(24.6)(24.6)⟨E⟩=12m⟨(dx/dt)2⟩+12mω02⟨x2⟩=12m(ω2+ω02)12x02.
Now, when an oscillator is very efficient, and if ωω is near
ω0ω0, so that |x^||x^| is large, the stored energy is
very high—we can get a large stored energy from a relatively small
force. The force does a great deal of work in getting the oscillation
going, but then to keep it steady, all it has to do is to fight the
friction. The oscillator can have a great deal of energy if the
friction is very low, and even though it is oscillating strongly, not
much energy is being lost. The efficiency of an oscillator can be
measured by how much energy is stored, compared with how much work the
force does per oscillation.
How does the stored energy compare with the amount of work that is
done in one cycle? This is called the QQ of the system, and QQ is
defined as 2π2π times the mean stored energy, divided by the work
done per cycle. (If we were to say the work done per radian
instead of per cycle, then the 2π2π disappears.)
Q=2π12m(ω2+ω20)⋅⟨x2⟩γmω2⟨x2⟩⋅2π/ω=ω2+ω202γω.(24.7)(24.7)Q=2π12m(ω2+ω02)⋅⟨x2⟩γmω2⟨x2⟩⋅2π/ω=ω2+ω022γω.
QQ is not a very useful number unless it is very large. When it is
relatively large, it gives a measure of how good the oscillator
is. People have tried to define QQ in the simplest and most useful
way; various definitions differ a bit from one another, but if QQ is
very large, all definitions are in agreement. The most generally
accepted definition is Eq. (24.7), which depends
on ωω. For a good oscillator, close to resonance, we can
simplify (24.7) a little by setting ω=ω0ω=ω0, and we
then have Q=ω0/γQ=ω0/γ, which is the definition of QQ that we
used before.
What is QQ for an electrical circuit? To find out, we merely have to
translate LL for mm, RR for mγmγ, and 1/C1/C for mω20mω02
(see Table 23–1). The QQ at resonance is Lω/RLω/R,
where ωω is the resonance frequency. If we consider a circuit
with a high QQ, that means that the amount of energy stored in the
oscillation is very large compared with the amount of work done per
cycle by the machinery that drives the oscillations.
24–2Damped oscillations
We now turn to our main topic of discussion: transients. By a
transient is meant a solution of the differential equation when
there is no force present, but when the system is not simply at
rest. (Of course, if it is standing still at the origin with no force
acting, that is a nice problem—it stays there!) Suppose the
oscillation starts another way: say it was driven by a force for a
while, and then we turn off the force. What happens then? Let us first
get a rough idea of what will happen for a very high QQ system. So
long as a force is acting, the stored energy stays the same, and there
is a certain amount of work done to maintain it. Now suppose we turn
off the force, and no more work is being done; then the losses which
are eating up the energy of the supply are no longer eating up its
energy—there is no more driver. The losses will have to
consume, so to speak, the energy that is stored. Let us suppose that
Q/2π=1000Q/2π=1000. Then the work done per cycle is 1/10001/1000 of the
stored energy. Is it not reasonable, since it is oscillating with no
driving force, that in one cycle the system will still lose a
thousandth of its energy EE, which ordinarily would have been
supplied from the outside, and that it will continue oscillating,
always losing 1/10001/1000 of its energy per cycle? So, as a guess, for a
relatively high QQ system, we would suppose that the following
equation might be roughly right (we will later do it exactly, and it
will turn out that it was right!):
dE/dt=−ωE/Q.(24.8)(24.8)dE/dt=−ωE/Q.
This is rough because it is true only for large QQ. In each radian
the system loses a fraction 1/Q1/Q of the stored energy EE. Thus in a
given amount of time dtdt the energy will change by an
amount ωdt/Qωdt/Q, since the number of radians associated with the
time dtdt is ωdtωdt. What is the frequency? Let us suppose that the
system moves so nicely, with hardly any force, that if we let go it
will oscillate at essentially the same frequency all by itself. So we
will guess that ωω is the resonant frequency ω0ω0. Then we
deduce from Eq. (24.8) that the stored energy will vary
as
E=E0e−ω0t/Q=E0e−γt.(24.9)(24.9)E=E0e−ω0t/Q=E0e−γt.
This would be the measure of the energy at any moment. What
would the formula be, roughly, for the amplitude of the oscillation as
a function of the time? The same? No! The amount of energy in a
spring, say, goes as the square of the displacement; the
kinetic energy goes as the square of the velocity; so the total
energy goes as the square of the displacement. Thus the
displacement, the amplitude of oscillation, will decrease half as fast
because of the square. In other words, we guess that the solution for
the damped transient motion will be an oscillation of frequency close
to the resonance frequency ω0ω0, in which the amplitude of the
sine-wave motion will diminish as e−γt/2e−γt/2:
x=A0e−γt/2cosω0t.(24.10)(24.10)x=A0e−γt/2cos⁡ω0t.
This equation and Fig. 24–1 give us an idea of what we
should expect; now let us try to analyze the motion precisely
by solving the differential equation of the motion itself.
Fig. 24–1.A damped cosine oscillation.
So, starting with Eq. (24.1), with no outside force, how
do we solve it? Being physicists, we do not have to worry about the
method as much as we do about what the solution
is. Armed with our previous experience, let us try as a
solution an exponential curve, x=Aeiαtx=Aeiαt. (Why do we try
this? It is the easiest thing to differentiate!) We put this
into (24.1) (with F(t)=0F(t)=0), using the rule that each time
we differentiate xx with respect to time, we multiply by iαiα. So
it is really quite simple to substitute. Thus our equation looks like
this:
(−α2+iγα+ω20)Aeiαt=0.(24.11)(24.11)(−α2+iγα+ω02)Aeiαt=0.
The net result must be zero for all times, which is impossible
unless (a) A=0A=0, which is no solution at all—it stands still, or
(b)
−α2+iαγ+ω20=0.(24.12)(24.12)−α2+iαγ+ω02=0.
If we can solve this and find an αα, then we will have a
solution in which AA need not be zero!
α=iγ/2±ω20−γ2/4−−−−−−−−√.(24.13)(24.13)α=iγ/2±ω02−γ2/4.
For a while we shall assume that γγ is fairly small compared
with ω0ω0, so that ω20−γ2/4ω02−γ2/4 is definitely
positive, and there is nothing the matter with taking the square
root. The only bothersome thing is that we get two solutions!
Thus
α1=iγ/2+ω20−γ2/4−−−−−−−−√=iγ/2+ωγ(24.14)(24.14)α1=iγ/2+ω02−γ2/4=iγ/2+ωγ
and
α2=iγ/2−ω20−γ2/4−−−−−−−−√=iγ/2−ωγ.(24.15)(24.15)α2=iγ/2−ω02−γ2/4=iγ/2−ωγ.
Let us consider the first one, supposing that we had not noticed that
the square root has two possible values. Then we know that a solution
for xx is x1=Aeiα1tx1=Aeiα1t, where AA is any constant
whatever. Now, in substituting α1α1, because it is going to come
so many times and it takes so long to write, we shall call
ω20−γ2/4−−−−−−−−√=ωγω02−γ2/4=ωγ. Thus
iα1=−γ/2+iωγiα1=−γ/2+iωγ, and we get x=Ae(−γ/2+iωγ)tx=Ae(−γ/2+iωγ)t, or what is the same, because of the
wonderful properties of an exponential,
x1=Ae−γt/2eiωγt.(24.16)(24.16)x1=Ae−γt/2eiωγt.
First, we recognize this as an oscillation, an oscillation at a
frequency ωγωγ, which is not exactly the
frequency ω0ω0, but is rather close to ω0ω0 if it is a good
system. Second, the amplitude of the oscillation is decreasing
exponentially! If we take, for instance, the real part
of (24.16), we get
x1=Ae−γt/2cosωγt.(24.17)(24.17)x1=Ae−γt/2cos⁡ωγt.
This is very much like our guessed-at solution (24.10),
except that the frequency really is ωγωγ. This is the only
error, so it is the same thing—we have the right idea. But
everything is not all right! What is not all right is that
there is another solution.
The other solution is α2α2, and we see that the difference is
only that the sign of ωγωγ is reversed:
x2=Be−γt/2e−iωγt.(24.18)(24.18)x2=Be−γt/2e−iωγt.
What does this mean? We shall soon prove that if x1x1 and x2x2 are
each a possible solution of Eq. (24.1) with F=0F=0, then
x1+x2x1+x2 is also a solution of the same equation! So the general
solution xx is of the mathematical form
x=e−γt/2(Aeiωγt+Be−iωγt).(24.19)(24.19)x=e−γt/2(Aeiωγt+Be−iωγt).
Now we may wonder why we bother to give this other solution, since we
were so happy with the first one all by itself. What is the extra one
for, because of course we know we should only take the real part?
We know that we must take the real part, but how did the
mathematics know that we only wanted the real part? When we had
a nonzero driving force F(t)F(t), we put in an artificial force
to go with it, and the imaginary part of the equation, so to
speak, was driven in a definite way. But when we put F(t)≡0F(t)≡0,
our convention that xx should be only the real part of whatever we
write down is purely our own, and the mathematical equations do not
know it yet. The physical world has a real solution, but the
answer that we were so happy with before is not real, it is
complex. The equation does not know that we are
arbitrarily going to take the real part, so it has to present us, so
to speak, with a complex conjugate type of solution, so that by
putting them together we can make a truly real solution; that
is what α2α2 is doing for us. In order for xx to be real,
Be−iωγtBe−iωγt will have to be the complex conjugate
of AeiωγtAeiωγt that the imaginary parts disappear. So it turns
out that BB is the complex conjugate of AA, and our real solution is
x=e−γt/2(Aeiωγt+A∗e−iωγt).(24.20)(24.20)x=e−γt/2(Aeiωγt+A∗e−iωγt).
So our real solution is an oscillation with a phase shift and a
damping—just as advertised.
24–3Electrical transients
Fig. 24–2.An electrical circuit for demonstrating transients.
Now let us see if the above really works. We construct the electrical circuit
shown in Fig. 24–2, in which we apply to an oscilloscope the voltage
across the inductance LL after we suddenly turn on a voltage by closing the
switch SS. It is an oscillatory circuit, and it generates a transient of some
kind. It corresponds to a circumstance in which we suddenly apply a force and
the system starts to oscillate. It is the electrical analog of a damped
mechanical oscillator, and we watch the oscillation on an oscilloscope, where we
should see the curves that we were trying to analyze. (The horizontal motion of
the oscilloscope is driven at a uniform speed, while the vertical motion is the
voltage across the inductor. The rest of the circuit is only a technical detail.
We would like to repeat the experiment many, many times, since the persistence
of vision is not good enough to see only one trace on the screen. So we do the
experiment again and again by closing the switch 6060 times a second; each time
we close the switch, we also start the oscilloscope horizontal sweep, and it
draws the curve over and over.) In Figs. 24–3
to 24–6 we see examples of damped oscillations, actually
photographed on an oscilloscope
screen. Figure 24–3 shows a damped
oscillation in a circuit which has a high QQ, a small γγ. It does not die
out very fast; it oscillates many times on the way down.
Figure 24–3
Figure 24–4
Figure 24–5
Figure 24–6
But let us see what happens as we decrease QQ, so that the
oscillation dies out more rapidly. We can decrease QQ by increasing
the resistance RR in the circuit. When we increase the resistance in
the circuit, it dies out faster (Fig. 24–4). Then if we
increase the resistance in the circuit still more, it dies out faster
still (Fig. 24–5). But when we put in more than a
certain amount, we cannot see any oscillation at all! The question is,
is this because our eyes are not good enough? If we increase the
resistance still more, we get a curve like that of
Fig. 24–6, which does not appear to have any oscillations,
except perhaps one. Now, how can we explain that by mathematics?
The resistance is, of course, proportional to the γγ term in the
mechanical device. Specifically, γγ is R/LR/L. Now if we increase
the γγ in the solutions (24.14) and (24.15)
that we were so happy with before, chaos sets in when γ/2γ/2 exceeds
ω0ω0; we must write it a different way, as
iγ/2+iγ2/4−ω20−−−−−−−−√andiγ/2−iγ2/4−ω20−−−−−−−−√.iγ/2+iγ2/4−ω02andiγ/2−iγ2/4−ω02.
Those are now the two solutions and, following the same line of
mathematical reasoning as previously, we again find two solutions:
eiα1teiα1t and eiα2teiα2t. If we now substitute for
α1α1, we get
x=Ae−(γ/2+γ2/4−ω20√)t,x=Ae−(γ/2+γ2/4−ω02)t,
a nice exponential decay with no oscillations. Likewise, the other
solution is
x=Be−(γ/2−γ2/4−ω20√)t.x=Be−(γ/2−γ2/4−ω02)t.
Note that the square root cannot exceed γ/2γ/2, because even if
ω0=0ω0=0, one term just equals the other. But ω20ω02 is
taken away from γ2/4γ2/4, so the square root is less than
γ/2γ/2, and the term in parentheses is, therefore, always a
positive number. Thank goodness!
Why? Because if it were negative, we
would find ee raised to a positive factor times tt, which
would mean it was exploding! In putting more and more resistance into
the circuit, we know it is not going to explode—quite the
contrary. So now we have two solutions, each one by itself a dying
exponential, but one having a much faster “dying rate” than the
other. The general solution is of course a combination of the two; the
coefficients in the combination depending upon how the motion
starts—what the initial conditions of the problem are. In the
particular way this circuit happens to be starting, the AA is
negative and the BB is positive, so we get the difference of two
exponential curves.
Now let us discuss how we can find the two coefficients AA and BB
(or AA and A∗A∗), if we know how the motion was started.
Suppose that at t=0t=0 we know that x=x0x=x0, and dx/dt=v0dx/dt=v0. If
we put t=0t=0, x=x0x=x0, and dx/dt=v0dx/dt=v0 into the expressions
x=e−γt/2(dx/dt=e−γt/2[Aeiωγt+A∗e−iωγt),(−γ/2+iωγ)Aeiωγt+(−γ/2−iωγ)A∗e−iωγt],x=e−γt/2(Aeiωγt+A∗e−iωγt),dx/dt=e−γt/2[(−γ/2+iωγ)Aeiωγt+(−γ/2−iωγ)A∗e−iωγt],
we find, since e0=e0= ei0=ei0= 11,
x0v0=A+A∗=2AR,=−(γ/2)(A+A∗)+iωγ(A−A∗)=−γx0/2+iωγ(2iAI),x0=A+A∗=2AR,v0=−(γ/2)(A+A∗)+iωγ(A−A∗)=−γx0/2+iωγ(2iAI),
where A=AR+iAIA=AR+iAI, and A∗=AR−iAIA∗=AR−iAI. Thus we find
AR=x0/2AR=x0/2
and
AI=−(v0+γx0/2)/2ωγ.(24.21)(24.21)AI=−(v0+γx0/2)/2ωγ.
This completely determines AA and A∗A∗, and therefore the
complete curve of the transient solution, in terms of how it
begins. Incidentally, we can write the solution another way if we note
that
eiθ+e−iθ=2cosθandeiθ−e−iθ=2isinθ.eiθ+e−iθ=2cos⁡θandeiθ−e−iθ=2isin⁡θ.
We may then write the complete solution as
x=e−γt/2[x0cosωγt+v0+γx0/2ωγsinωγt],(24.22)(24.22)x=e−γt/2[x0cos⁡ωγt+v0+γx0/2ωγsin⁡ωγt],
where ωγ=+ω20−γ2/4−−−−−−−−√ωγ=+ω02−γ2/4. This is the
mathematical expression for the way an oscillation dies out. We shall
not make direct use of it, but there are a number of points we should
like to emphasize that are true in more general cases.
First of all the behavior of such a system with no external force is
expressed by a sum, or superposition, of pure exponentials in time
(which we wrote as eiαteiαt). This is a good solution to try in
such circumstances. The values of αα may be complex in general,
the imaginary parts representing damping. Finally the intimate
mathematical relation of the sinusoidal and exponential function
discussed in Chapter 22 often appears physically as a
change from oscillatory to exponential behavior when some physical
parameter (in this case resistance, γγ) exceeds some critical
value.
