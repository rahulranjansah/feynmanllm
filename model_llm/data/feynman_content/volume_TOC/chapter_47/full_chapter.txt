47Sound. The wave equation
47–1Waves
In this chapter we shall discuss the phenomenon of waves. This
is a phenomenon which appears in many contexts throughout physics, and
therefore our attention should be concentrated on it not only because
of the particular example considered here, which is sound, but also
because of the much wider application of the ideas in all branches of
physics.
It was pointed out when we studied the harmonic oscillator that there
are not only mechanical examples of oscillating systems but electrical
ones as well. Waves are related to oscillating systems, except that
wave oscillations appear not only as time-oscillations at one place,
but propagate in space as well.
We have really already studied waves. When we studied light, in
learning about the properties of waves in that subject, we paid
particular attention to the interference in space of waves from
several sources at different locations and all at the same
frequency. There are two important wave phenomena that we have not yet
discussed which occur in light, i.e., electromagnetic waves, as well
as in any other form of waves. The first of these is the phenomenon of
interference in time rather than interference in space. If we
have two sources of sound which have slightly different frequencies
and if we listen to both at the same time, then sometimes the waves
come with the crests together and sometimes with the crest and trough
together (see Fig. 47–1). The rising and falling of the
sound that results is the phenomenon of beats or, in other
words, of interference in time. The second phenomenon involves the
wave patterns which result when the waves are confined within a given
volume and reflect back and forth from walls.
Fig. 47–1.Interference in time of two sound sources with slightly
different frequencies, resulting in beats.
These effects could have been discussed, of course, for the case of
electromagnetic waves. The reason for not having done this is that by
using one example we would not generate the feeling that we are
actually learning about many different subjects at the same time. In
order to emphasize the general applicability of waves beyond
electrodynamics, we consider here a different example, in particular
sound waves.
Other examples of waves are water waves consisting of long swells that
we see coming in to the shore, or the smaller water waves consisting
of surface tension ripples. As another example, there are two kinds of
elastic waves in solids; a compressional (or longitudinal) wave in
which the particles of the solid oscillate back and forth along the
direction of propagation of the wave (sound waves in a gas are of this
kind), and a transverse wave in which the particles of the solid
oscillate in a direction perpendicular to the direction of
propagation. Earthquake waves contain elastic waves of both kinds,
generated by a motion at some place in the earth’s crust.
Still another example of waves is found in modern physics. These are
waves which give the probability amplitude of finding a particle at a
given place—the “matter waves” which we have already
discussed. Their frequency is proportional to the energy and their
wave number is proportional to the momentum. They are the waves of
quantum mechanics.
In this chapter we shall consider only waves for which the velocity is
independent of the wavelength. This is, for example, the case for
light in a vacuum. The speed of light is then the same for radiowaves,
blue light, green light, or for any other wavelength. Because of this
behavior, when we began to describe the wave phenomenon we did not
notice at first that we had wave propagation. Instead, we said that if
a charge is moved at one place, the electric field at a distance xx
was proportional to the acceleration, not at the time tt, but at the
earlier time t−x/ct−x/c. Therefore if we were to picture the electric
field in space at some instant of time, as in Fig. 47–2,
the electric field at a time tt later would have moved the
distance ctct, as indicated in the figure. Mathematically, we can say that in
the one-dimensional example we are taking, the electric field is a
function of x−ctx−ct. We see that at t=0t=0, it is some function
of xx. If we consider a later time, we need only to increase xx
somewhat to get the same value of the electric field. For example, if
the maximum field occurred at x=3x=3 at time zero, then to find the
new position of the maximum field at time tt we need
x−ct=3orx=3+ct.x−ct=3orx=3+ct.
We see that this kind of function represents the propagation of a
wave.
Fig. 47–2.The solid curve shows what the electric field might be like
at some instant of time and the dashed curve shows what the electric
field is at a time tt later.
Such a function, f(x−ct)f(x−ct), then represents a wave. We may summarize
this description of a wave by saying simply that
f(x−ct)=f(x+Δx−c(t+Δt)),f(x−ct)=f(x+Δx−c(t+Δt)),
when Δx=cΔtΔx=cΔt. There is, of course, another
possibility, i.e., that instead of a source to the left as indicated
in Fig. 47–2, we have a source on the right, so that the
wave propagates toward negative xx. Then the wave would be described
by g(x+ct)g(x+ct).
There is the additional possibility that more than one wave exists in
space at the same time, and so the electric field is the sum of the
two fields, each one propagating independently. This behavior of
electric fields may be described by saying that if f1(x−ct)f1(x−ct) is a
wave, and if f2(x−ct)f2(x−ct) is another wave, then their sum is also a
wave. This is called the principle of superposition. The same
principle is valid in sound.
We are familiar with the fact that if a sound is produced, we hear
with complete fidelity the same sequence of sounds as was
generated. If we had high frequencies travelling faster than low
frequencies, a short, sharp noise would be heard as a succession of
musical sounds. Similarly, if red light travelled faster than blue
light, a flash of white light would be seen first as red, then as
white, and finally as blue. We are familiar with the fact that this is
not the case. Both sound and light travel with a speed in air which is
very nearly independent of frequency. Examples of wave propagation for
which this independence is not true will be considered in
Chapter 48.
In the case of light (electromagnetic waves) we gave a rule which
determined the electric field at a point as a result of the
acceleration of a charge. One might expect now that what we should do
is give a rule whereby some quality of the air, say the pressure, is
determined at a given distance from a source in terms of the source
motion, delayed by the travel time of the sound. In the case of light
this procedure was acceptable because all that we knew was that a
charge at one place exerts a force on another charge at another
place. The details of propagation from the one place to the other were
not absolutely essential. In the case of sound, however, we know that
it propagates through the air between the source and the hearer, and
it is certainly a natural question to ask what, at any given moment,
the pressure of the air is. We would like, in addition, to know
exactly how the air moves. In the case of electricity we could accept
a rule, since we could say that we do not yet know the laws of
electricity, but we cannot make the same remark with regard to
sound. We would not be satisfied with a rule stating how the sound
pressure moves through the air, because the process ought to be
understandable as a consequence of the laws of mechanics. In short,
sound is a branch of mechanics, and so it is to be understood in terms
of Newton’s laws. The propagation of sound from one place to another
is merely a consequence of mechanics and the properties of gases, if
it propagates in a gas, or of the properties of liquids or solids, if
it propagates through such mediums. Later we shall derive the
properties of light and its wave propagation in a similar way from the
laws of electrodynamics.
47–2The propagation of sound
We shall give a derivation of the properties of the propagation of
sound between the source and the receiver as a consequence of
Newton’s laws, and we shall not consider the interaction with the
source and the receiver. Ordinarily we emphasize a result rather than
a particular derivation of it. In this chapter we take the opposite
view. The point here, in a certain sense, is the derivation
itself. This problem of explaining new phenomena in terms of old ones,
when we know the laws of the old ones, is perhaps the greatest art of
mathematical physics. The mathematical physicist has two problems: one
is to find solutions, given the equations, and the other is to find
the equations which describe a new phenomenon. The derivation here is
an example of the second kind of problem.
We shall take the simplest example here—the propagation of sound in
one dimension. To carry out such a derivation it is necessary first to
have some kind of understanding of what is going on. Fundamentally
what is involved is that if an object is moved at one place in the
air, we observe that there is a disturbance which travels through the
air. If we ask what kind of disturbance, we would say that we would
expect that the motion of the object produces a change of pressure. Of
course, if the object is moved gently, the air merely flows around it,
but what we are concerned with is a rapid motion, so that there is not
sufficient time for such a flow. Then, with the motion, the air is
compressed and a change of pressure is produced which pushes on
additional air. This air is in turn compressed, which leads again to
an extra pressure, and a wave is propagated.
We now want to formulate such a process. We have to decide what
variables we need. In our particular problem we would need to know how
much the air has moved, so that the air displacement in the
sound wave is certainly one relevant variable. In addition we would
like to describe how the air density changes as it is
displaced. The air pressure also changes, so this is another
variable of interest. Then, of course, the air has a velocity,
so that we shall have to describe the velocity of the air
particles. The air particles also have accelerations—but as
we list these many variables we soon realize that the velocity and
acceleration would be known if we knew how the air displacement
varies with time.
As we said, we shall consider the wave in one dimension. We can do
this if we are sufficiently far from the source that what we call the
wavefronts are very nearly planes. We thus make our argument
simpler by taking the least complicated example. We shall then be able
to say that the displacement, χχ, depends only on xx and tt, and
not on yy and zz. Therefore the description of the air is given
by χ(x,t)χ(x,t).
Is this description complete? It would appear to be far from complete,
for we know none of the details of how the air molecules are
moving. They are moving in all directions, and this state of affairs
is certainly not described by means of this function χ(x,t)χ(x,t). From
the point of view of kinetic theory, if we have a higher density of
molecules at one place and a lower density adjacent to that place, the
molecules would move away from the region of higher density to the one
of lower density, so as to equalize this difference. Apparently we
would not get an oscillation and there would be no sound. What is
necessary to get the sound wave is this situation: as the molecules
rush out of the region of higher density and higher pressure, they
give momentum to the molecules in the adjacent region of lower
density. For sound to be generated, the regions over which the density
and pressure change must be much larger than the distance the
molecules travel before colliding with other molecules. This distance
is the mean free path and the distance between pressure crests and
troughs must be much larger than this. Otherwise the molecules would
move freely from the crest to the trough and immediately smear out the
wave.
It is clear that we are going to describe the gas behavior on a scale
large compared with the mean free path, and so the properties of the
gas will not be described in terms of the individual molecules. The
displacement, for example, will be the displacement of the center of
mass of a small element of the gas, and the pressure or density will
be the pressure or density in this region. We shall call the
pressure PP and the density ρρ, and they will be functions of xx
and tt. We must keep in mind that this description is an approximation
which is valid only when these gas properties do not vary too rapidly
with distance.
47–3The wave equation
The physics of the phenomenon of sound waves thus involves three features:
The gas moves and changes the density.
The change in density corresponds to a change in pressure.
Pressure inequalities generate gas motion.
Let us consider II first. For a gas, a liquid, or a solid, the
pressure is some function of the density. Before the sound wave
arrives, we have equilibrium, with a pressure P0P0 and a
corresponding density ρ0ρ0. A pressure PP in the medium is
connected to the density by some characteristic relation P=f(ρ)P=f(ρ)
and, in particular, the equilibrium pressure P0P0 is given by P0=f(ρ0)P0=f(ρ0). The changes of pressure in sound from the equilibrium
value are extremely small. A convenient unit for measuring pressure is
the bar, where 11 bar=105=105 N/m². The pressure of
11 standard atmosphere is very nearly 11 bar: 11 atm=1.0133=1.0133 bars.
In sound we use a logarithmic scale of intensities since the
sensitivity of the ear is roughly logarithmic. This scale is the
decibel scale, in which the acoustic pressure level for the pressure
amplitude PP is defined as
I(acousticpressurelevel)=20log10(P/Pref) in dB,(47.1)(47.1)I(acousticpressurelevel)=20log10⁡(P/Pref) in dB,
where the reference pressure Pref=2×10−10Pref=2×10−10 bar. A
pressure amplitude of P=P= 103Pref=103Pref= 2×10−72×10−7
bar1 corresponds to a
moderately intense sound of 6060 decibels. We see that the pressure
changes in sound are extremely small compared with the equilibrium, or
mean, pressure of 11 atm. The displacements and the density changes
are correspondingly extremely small. In explosions we do not have such
small changes; the excess pressures produced can be greater than
11 atm. These large pressure changes lead to new effects which we shall
consider later. In sound we do not often consider acoustic intensity
levels over 100100 dB; 120120 dB is a level which is painful to the
ear. Therefore, for sound, if we write
P=P0+Pe,ρ=ρ0+ρe,(47.2)(47.2)P=P0+Pe,ρ=ρ0+ρe,
we shall always have the pressure change PePe very small compared
with P0P0 and the density change ρeρe very small compared
with ρ0ρ0. Then
P0+Pe=f(ρ0+ρe)=f(ρ0)+ρef′(ρ0),(47.3)(47.3)P0+Pe=f(ρ0+ρe)=f(ρ0)+ρef′(ρ0),
where P0=f(ρ0)P0=f(ρ0) and f′(ρ0)f′(ρ0) stands for the derivative
of f(ρ)f(ρ) evaluated at ρ=ρ0ρ=ρ0. We can take the second step in
this equality only because ρeρe is very small. We find in this way
that the excess pressure PePe is proportional to the excess
density ρeρe, and we may call the proportionality factor κκ:
Pe=κρe,where κ=f′(ρ0)=(dP/dρ)0.(II)(47.4)(47.4)Pe=κρe,where κ=f′(ρ0)=(dP/dρ)0.(II)
The relation we needed for II is this very simple one.
Fig. 47–3.The displacement of the air at xx is χ(x,t)χ(x,t), and at x+Δxx+Δx it is χ(x+Δx,t)χ(x+Δx,t). The original volume of
the air for a unit area of the plane wave is ΔxΔx; the new
volume is Δx+χ(x+Δx,t)−χ(x,t)Δx+χ(x+Δx,t)−χ(x,t).
Let us now consider I. We shall suppose that the position of a portion
of air undisturbed by the sound wave is xx and the displacement at
the time tt due to the sound is χ(x,t)χ(x,t), so that its new position
is x+χ(x,t)x+χ(x,t), as in Fig. 47–3. Now the undisturbed
position of a nearby portion of air is x+Δxx+Δx, and its new
position is x+Δx+χ(x+Δx,t)x+Δx+χ(x+Δx,t). We can now find the
density changes in the following way. Since we are limiting ourselves
to plane waves, we can take a unit area perpendicular to the
xx-direction, which is the direction of propagation of the sound
wave. The amount of air, per unit area, in ΔxΔx is then
ρ0Δxρ0Δx, where ρ0ρ0 is the undisturbed, or equilibrium,
air density. This air, when displaced by the sound wave, now lies
between x+χ(x,t)x+χ(x,t) and x+Δx+χ(x+Δx,t)x+Δx+χ(x+Δx,t), so
that we have the same matter in this interval that was in ΔxΔx
when undisturbed. If ρρ is the new density, then
ρ0Δx=ρ[x+Δx+χ(x+Δx,t)−x−χ(x,t)].(47.5)(47.5)ρ0Δx=ρ[x+Δx+χ(x+Δx,t)−x−χ(x,t)].
Since ΔxΔx is small, we can write χ(x+Δx,t)−χ(x,t)=(∂χ/∂x)Δxχ(x+Δx,t)−χ(x,t)=(∂χ/∂x)Δx. This derivative is a partial
derivative, since χχ depends on the time as well as on xx. Our
equation then is
ρ0Δx=ρ(∂χ∂xΔx+Δx)(47.6)(47.6)ρ0Δx=ρ(∂χ∂xΔx+Δx)
or
ρ0=(ρ0+ρe)∂χ∂x+ρ0+ρe.(47.7)(47.7)ρ0=(ρ0+ρe)∂χ∂x+ρ0+ρe.
Now in sound waves all changes are small so that ρeρe is small,
χχ is small, and ∂χ/∂x∂χ/∂x is also small. Therefore in the
relation that we have just found,
ρe=−ρ0∂χ∂x−ρe∂χ∂x,(47.8)(47.8)ρe=−ρ0∂χ∂x−ρe∂χ∂x,
we can neglect ρe∂χ/∂xρe∂χ/∂x compared with
ρ0∂χ/∂xρ0∂χ/∂x. Thus we get the relation we needed for I:
ρe=−ρ0∂χ∂x.(I)(47.9)(47.9)ρe=−ρ0∂χ∂x.(I)
This equation is what we would expect physically. If the displacements
vary with xx, then there will be density changes. The sign is also
right: if the displacement χχ increases with xx, so that the air
is stretched out, the density must go down.
Fig. 47–4.The net force in the positive xx-direction produced by the
pressure acting on unit area perpendicular to xx
is −(∂P/∂x)Δx−(∂P/∂x)Δx.
We now need the third equation, which is the equation of the motion
produced by the pressure. If we know the relation between the force
and the pressure, we can then get the equation of motion. If we take a
thin slab of air of length ΔxΔx and of unit area perpendicular
to xx, then the mass of air in this slab is ρ0Δxρ0Δx and it
has the acceleration ∂2χ/∂t2∂2χ/∂t2, so the mass times
the acceleration for this slab of matter is ρ0Δx(∂2χ/∂t2)ρ0Δx(∂2χ/∂t2). (It makes no difference for small
ΔxΔx whether the acceleration ∂2χ/∂t2∂2χ/∂t2 is
evaluated at an edge of the slab or at some intermediate position.) If
now we find the force on this matter for a unit area perpendicular
to xx, it will then be equal to ρ0Δx(∂2χ/∂t2)ρ0Δx(∂2χ/∂t2). We have the force in the
+x+x-direction, at xx, of amount P(x,t)P(x,t) per unit area, and we have
the force in the opposite direction, at x+Δxx+Δx, of amount P(x+Δx,t)P(x+Δx,t) per unit area (Fig. 47–4):
P(x,t)−P(x+Δx,t)=−∂P∂xΔx=−∂Pe∂xΔx,(47.10)P(x,t)−P(x+Δx,t)=−∂P∂xΔx(47.10)=−∂Pe∂xΔx,
since ΔxΔx is small and since the only part of PP which changes
is the excess pressure PePe. We now have III:
ρ0∂2χ∂t2=−∂Pe∂x,(III)(47.11)(47.11)ρ0∂2χ∂t2=−∂Pe∂x,(III)
and so we have enough equations to interconnect things and reduce down
to one variable, say to χχ. We can eliminate PePe from III by
using II, so that we get
ρ0∂2χ∂t2=−κ∂ρe∂x,(47.12)(47.12)ρ0∂2χ∂t2=−κ∂ρe∂x,
and then we can use I to eliminate ρeρe. In this way we find that
ρ0ρ0 cancels out and that we are left with
∂2χ∂t2=κ∂2χ∂x2.(47.13)(47.13)∂2χ∂t2=κ∂2χ∂x2.
We shall call c2s=κcs2=κ, so that we can write
∂2χ∂x2=1c2s∂2χ∂t2.(47.14)(47.14)∂2χ∂x2=1cs2∂2χ∂t2.
This is the wave equation which describes the behavior of sound in
matter.
47–4Solutions of the wave equation
We now can see whether this equation really does describe the
essential properties of sound waves in matter. We want to deduce that
a sound pulse, or disturbance, will move with a constant speed. We
want to verify that two different pulses can move through each
other—the principle of superposition. We also want to verify that
sound can go either to the right or to the left. All these properties
should be contained in this one equation.
We have remarked that any plane-wave disturbance which moves with a
constant velocity vv has the form f(x−vt)f(x−vt). Now we have to see
whether χ(x,t)=f(x−vt)χ(x,t)=f(x−vt) is a solution of the wave
equation. When we calculate ∂χ/∂x∂χ/∂x, we get the derivative of
the function, ∂χ/∂x=f′(x−vt)∂χ/∂x=f′(x−vt). Differentiating once
more, we find
∂2χ∂x2=f′′(x−vt).(47.15)(47.15)∂2χ∂x2=f″(x−vt).
The differentiation of this same function with respect to tt gives
−v−v times the derivative of the function, or ∂χ/∂t=−vf′(x−vt)∂χ/∂t=−vf′(x−vt), and the second time derivative is
∂2χ∂t2=v2f′′(x−vt).(47.16)(47.16)∂2χ∂t2=v2f″(x−vt).
It is evident that f(x−vt)f(x−vt) will satisfy the wave equation provided
the wave velocity vv is equal to cscs.
We find, therefore, from the laws of mechanics that any sound
disturbance propagates with the velocity cscs, and in addition we
find that
cs=κ1/2=(dP/dρ)1/20,cs=κ1/2=(dP/dρ)01/2,
and so we have related the wave velocity to a property of the
medium.
If we consider a wave travelling in the opposite direction, so that
χ(x,t)=g(x+vt)χ(x,t)=g(x+vt), it is easy to see that such a disturbance
also satisfies the wave equation. The only difference between such a
wave and one travelling from left to right is in the sign of vv, but
whether we have x+vtx+vt or x−vtx−vt as the variable in the function
does not affect the sign of ∂2χ/∂t2∂2χ/∂t2, since it
involves only v2v2. It follows that we have a solution for waves
propagating in either direction with speed cscs.
An extremely interesting question is that of superposition. Suppose
one solution of the wave equation has been found, say χ1χ1. This
means that the second derivative of χ1χ1 with respect to xx is
equal to 1/c2s1/cs2 times the second derivative of χ1χ1 with
respect to tt. Now any other solution χ2χ2 has this same
property. If we superpose these two solutions, we have
χ(x,t)=χ1(x,t)+χ2(x,t),(47.17)(47.17)χ(x,t)=χ1(x,t)+χ2(x,t),
and we wish to verify that χ(x,t)χ(x,t) is also a wave, i.e., that
χχ satisfies the wave equation. We can easily prove this result,
since we have
∂2χ∂x2=∂2χ1∂x2+∂2χ2∂x2(47.18)(47.18)∂2χ∂x2=∂2χ1∂x2+∂2χ2∂x2
and, in addition,
∂2χ∂t2=∂2χ1∂t2+∂2χ2∂t2.(47.19)(47.19)∂2χ∂t2=∂2χ1∂t2+∂2χ2∂t2.
It follows that ∂2χ/∂x2=(1/c2s)∂2χ/∂t2∂2χ/∂x2=(1/cs2)∂2χ/∂t2, so we have verified the
principle of superposition. The
proof of the principle of superposition follows from the fact that the
wave equation is linear in χχ.
We can now expect that a plane light wave propagating in the
xx-direction, polarized so that the electric field is in the
yy-direction, will satisfy the wave equation
∂2Ey∂x2=1c2∂2Ey∂t2,(47.20)(47.20)∂2Ey∂x2=1c2∂2Ey∂t2,
where cc is the speed of light. This wave equation is one of the
consequences of Maxwell’s equations. The equations of electrodynamics will lead to the wave
equation for light just as the equations of mechanics lead to the wave
equation for sound.
47–5The speed of sound
Our deduction of the wave equation for sound has given us a
formula which connects the wave speed with the rate of change
of pressure with the density at the normal pressure:
c2s=(dPdρ)0.(47.21)(47.21)cs2=(dPdρ)0.
In evaluating this rate of change, it is essential to know how the
temperature varies. In a sound wave, we would expect that in the
region of compression the temperature would be raised, and that in the
region of rarefaction the temperature would be lowered.
Newton was the first to calculate
the rate of change of pressure with density, and he supposed that the
temperature remained unchanged. He argued that the heat was conducted
from one region to the other so rapidly that the temperature could not
rise or fall. This argument gives the isothermal speed of sound, and it
is wrong. The correct deduction was given later by
Laplace, who put forward
the opposite idea—that the pressure and temperature change
adiabatically in a sound wave. The heat flow from the compressed region
to the rarefied region is negligible so long as the wavelength is long
compared with the mean free path. Under this condition the slight amount
of heat flow in a sound wave does not affect the speed, although it
gives a small absorption of the sound energy. We can expect correctly
that this absorption increases as the wavelength approaches the mean
free path, but these wavelengths are smaller by factors of about a
million than the wavelengths of audible sound.
The actual variation of pressure with density in a sound wave is the
one that allows no heat flow. This corresponds to the adiabatic
variation, which we found to be PVγ=constPVγ=const, where VV
was the volume. Since the density ρρ varies inversely with VV,
the adiabatic connection between PP and ρρ is
P=constργ,(47.22)(47.22)P=constργ,
from which we get dP/dρ=γP/ρdP/dρ=γP/ρ. We then have for the
speed of sound the relation
c2s=γPρ.(47.23)(47.23)cs2=γPρ.
We can also write c2s=γPV/ρVcs2=γPV/ρV and make use of the
relation PV=NkTPV=NkT. Further, we see that ρVρV is the mass of gas,
which can also be expressed as NmNm, or as μμ per mole, where mm is the
mass of a molecule and μμ is the molecular weight. In this way we
find that
c2s=γkTm=γRTμ,(47.24)(47.24)cs2=γkTm=γRTμ,
from which it is evident that the speed of sound depends only on the
gas temperature and not on the pressure or the density. We also have
observed that
kT=13m⟨v2⟩,(47.25)(47.25)kT=13m⟨v2⟩,
where ⟨v2⟩⟨v2⟩ is the mean square of the speed of the molecules. It
follows that c2s=(γ/3)⟨v2⟩cs2=(γ/3)⟨v2⟩, or
cs=(γ3)1/2vav.(47.26)(47.26)cs=(γ3)1/2vav.
This equation states that the speed of sound is some number which is
roughly 1/(3)1/21/(3)1/2 times some average speed, vavvav, of
the molecules (the square root of the mean square velocity). In other
words, the speed of sound is of the same order of magnitude as the
speed of the molecules, and is actually somewhat less than this
average speed.
Of course we could expect such a result, because a disturbance like a
change in pressure is, after all, propagated by the motion of the
molecules. However, such an argument does not tell us the precise
propagation speed; it could have turned out that sound was carried
primarily by the fastest molecules, or by the slowest molecules. It is
reasonable and satisfying that the speed of sound is roughly
1212 of the average molecular speed vavvav.
With
this choice of PrefPref, the PP is not the
peak pressure in the sound wave but the “root-mean-square” pressure,
which is 1/(2)1/21/(2)1/2 times the peak pressure.
