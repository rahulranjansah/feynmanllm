36–1The sensation of color
In discussing the sense of sight, we have to realize that (outside
of
a gallery of modern art!) one does not see random spots of color or
spots of light. When we look at an object we see a man or a
thing; in other words, the brain interprets what we see. How it
does that, no one knows, and it does it, of course, at a very high
level. Although we evidently do learn to recognize what a man looks
like after much experience, there are a number of features of vision
which are more elementary but which also involve combining information
from different parts of what we see. To help us understand how we make
an interpretation of an entire image, it is worthwhile to study the
earliest stages of the putting together of information from the
different retinal cells. In the present chapter we shall concentrate
mainly on that aspect of vision, although we shall also mention a
number of side issues as we go along.
An example of the fact that we have an accumulation, at a very
elementary level, of information from several parts of the eye at the
same time, beyond our voluntary control or ability to learn, was that
blue shadow which was produced by white light when both white and red
were shining on the same screen. This effect at least involves the
knowledge that the background of the screen is pink, even though, when
we are looking at the blue shadow, it is only “white” light coming
into a particular spot in the eye; somewhere, pieces of information
have been put together. The more complete and familiar the context is,
the more the eye will make corrections for peculiarities. In fact,
Land has shown that if we mix that apparent blue and the red in
various proportions, by using two photographic transparencies with
absorption in front of the red and the white in different proportions,
it can be made to represent a real scene, with real objects, rather
faithfully. In this case we get a lot of intermediate apparent colors
too, analogous to what we would get by mixing red and blue-green; it
seems to be an almost complete set of colors, but if we look very hard
at them, they are not so very good. Even so, it is surprising how much
can be obtained from just red and white. The more the scene looks like
a real situation, the more one is able to compensate for the fact that
all the light is actually nothing but pink!
Fig. 36–1.When a disc like the above is spun, colors appear in only one
of the two darker “rings.” If the spin direction is reversed, the
colors appear in the other ring.
Another example is the appearance of “colors” in a black-and-white
rotating disc, whose black and white areas are as shown in
Fig. 36–1. When the disc is rotated, the variations of light
and dark at any one radius are exactly the same; it is only the
background that is different for the two kinds of “stripes.” Yet one
of the “rings” appears colored with one color and the other with
another.1
No one yet understands the reason for
those colors, but it is clear that information is being put together at
a very elementary level, in the eye itself, most likely.
Almost all present-day theories of color vision agree that the
color-mixing data indicate that there are only three pigments in the
cones of the eye, and that it
is the spectral absorption in those three pigments that fundamentally
produces the color sense. But the total sensation that is associated
with the absorption characteristics of the three pigments acting
together is not necessarily the sum of the individual sensations. We all
agree that yellow simply does not seem to be reddish green; in
fact it might be a tremendous surprise to most people to discover that
light is, in fact, a mixture of colors, because presumably the sensation
of light is due to some other process than a simple mixture like a chord
in music, where the three notes are there at the same time and if we
listen hard we can hear them individually. We cannot look hard and see
the red and the green.
The earliest theories of vision said that there are three pigments and
three kinds of cones,
each kind containing one pigment; that a nerve
runs from each cone to the brain, so that the three pieces of
information are carried to the brain; and then in the brain, anything
can happen. This, of course, is an incomplete idea: it does no good to
discover that the information is carried along the optic nerve to the
brain, because we have not even started to solve the problem. We must
ask more basic questions: Does it make any difference where the
information is put together? Is it important that it be carried right
up into the brain in the optic nerve, or could the retina do some
analysis first? We have seen a picture of the retina as an extremely
complicated thing with lots of interconnections (Fig. 35–2)
and it might make some analyses.
As a matter of fact, people who study anatomy and the development of
the eye have shown that the retina is, in fact, the brain: in the
development of the embryo, a piece of the brain comes out in front,
and long fibers grow back, connecting the eyes to the brain. The
retina is organized in just the way the brain is organized and, as
someone has beautifully put it, “The brain has developed a way to
look out upon the world.” The eye is a piece of brain that is
touching light, so to speak, on the outside. So it is not at all
unlikely that some analysis of the color has already been made in the
retina.
This gives us a very interesting opportunity. None of the other senses
involves such a large amount of calculation, so to speak, before the
signal gets into a nerve that one can make measurements on. The
calculations for all the rest of the senses usually happen in the
brain itself, where it is very difficult to get at specific places to
make measurements, because there are so many interconnections. Here,
with the visual sense, we have the light, three layers of cells making
calculations, and the results of the calculations being transmitted
through the optic nerve. So we have the first chance to observe
physiologically how, perhaps, the first layers of the brain work in
their first steps. It is thus of double interest, not simply
interesting for vision, but interesting to the whole problem of
physiology.
The fact that there are three pigments does not mean that there must
be three kinds of sensations. One of the other theories of color
vision has it that there are really opposing color schemes
(Fig. 36–2). That is, one of the nerve fibers carries a lot
of impulses if there is yellow being seen, and less than usual for blue.
Another nerve fiber carries green and red information in the same way,
and another, white and black. In other words, in this theory someone has
already started to make a guess as to the system of wiring, the method
of calculation.
Fig. 36–2.Neural connections according to an “opponent” theory of
color vision.
The problems we are trying to solve by guessing at these first
calculations are questions about the apparent colors that are seen on
a pink background, what happens when the eye is adapted to different
colors, and also the so-called psychological phenomena. The
psychological phenomena are of the nature, for instance, that white
does not “feel” like red and yellow and blue, and this theory was
advanced because the psychologists say that there are four
apparent pure colors: “There are four stimuli which have a remarkable
capacity to evoke psychologically simple blue, yellow, green, and red
hues respectively. Unlike sienna, magenta, purple, or most of the
discriminable colors, these simple hues are unmixed in the sense that
none partakes of the nature of the other; specifically, blue is not
yellowish, reddish, or greenish, and so on; these are psychologically
primary hues.” That is a psychological fact, so-called. To find out
from what evidence this psychological fact was deduced, we must search
very hard indeed through all the literature: In the modern literature
all we find on the subject are repeats of the same statement, or of
one by a German psychologist, who uses as one of his authorities
Leonardo da Vinci, who, of
course, we all know was a great artist. He says, “Leonardo thought
there were five colors.” Then, looking still further, we find, in a
still older book, the evidence for the subject. The book says something
like this: “Purple is reddish-blue, orange is reddish-yellow, but can
red be seen as purplish-orange? Are not red and yellow more unitary than
purple or orange? The average person, asked to state which colors are
unitary, names red, yellow, and blue, these three, and some observers
add a fourth, green. Psychologists are accustomed to accept the four as
salient hues.” So that is the situation in the psychological analysis
of this matter: if everybody says there are three, and somebody says
there are four, and they want it to be four, it will be four. That shows
the difficulty with psychological researches. It is clear that we have
such feelings, but it is very difficult to obtain much information about
them.
So the other direction to go is the physiological direction, to find
out experimentally what actually happens in the brain, the eye, the
retina, or wherever, and perhaps to discover that some combinations of
impulses from various cells move along certain nerve
fibers. Incidentally, primary pigments do not have to be in separate
cells; one could have cells in which are mixtures of the various
pigments, cells with the red and the green pigments, cells with all
three (the information of all three is then white information), and so
on. There are many ways of hooking the system up, and we have to find
out which way nature has used. It would be hoped, ultimately, that
when we understand the physiological connections we will have a little
bit of understanding of some of those aspects of the psychology, so we
look in that direction.
36–2The physiology of the eye
We begin by talking not only about color vision, but about vision in
general, just to remind ourselves about the interconnections in the
retina, shown in Fig. 35–2. The retina is really like
the surface of the brain. Although the actual picture through a
microscope is a little more complicated looking than this somewhat
schematized drawing, by careful analysis one can see all these
interconnections. There is no question that one part of the surface of
the retina is connected to other parts, and that the information that
comes out on the long axons, which produce the optic nerve, are
combinations of information from many cells. There are three layers of
cells in the succession of function: there are retinal cells, which
are the ones that the light affects, an intermediate cell which takes
information from a single or a few retinal cells and gives it out
again to several cells in a third layer of cells and carries it to the
brain. There are all kinds of cross connections between cells in the
layers.
We now turn to some aspects of the structure and performance of the
eye (see Fig. 35–1). The focusing of the light is
accomplished mainly by the cornea, by the fact that it has a curved
surface which “bends” the light. This is why we cannot see clearly
under water, because we then do not have enough difference between the
index of the cornea, which is 1.371.37, and that of the water, which
is 1.331.33. Behind the cornea is water, practically, with an index
of 1.331.33, and behind that is a lens which has a very interesting
structure: it is a series of layers, like an onion, except that it is
all transparent, and it has an index of 1.401.40 in the middle and
1.381.38 at the outside. (It would be nice if we could make optical
glass in which we could adjust the index throughout, for then we would
not have to curve it as much as we do when we have a uniform index.)
Furthermore, the shape of the cornea is not that of a sphere. A
spherical lens has a certain amount of spherical
aberration. The cornea is “flatter” at the outside than is a sphere, in
just such a manner that the spherical aberration is less for the cornea
than it would be if we put a spherical lens in there!
The light is
focused by the cornea-lens system onto the retina. As we look at things
that are closer and farther away, the lens tightens and loosens and
changes the focus to adjust for the different distances. To adjust for
the total amount of light there is the iris, which is what we call the
color of the eye, brown or blue, depending on who it is; as the amount
of light increases and decreases, the iris moves in and out.
Fig. 36–3.The neural interconnections for the mechanical operation of
the eyes.
Let us now look at the neural machinery for controlling the
accommodation of the lens, the motion of the eye, the muscles which
turn the eye in the socket, and the iris, shown schematically in
Fig. 36–3. Of all the information that comes out of the
optic nerve AA, the great majority is divided into one of two bundles
(which we will talk about later) and thence to the brain. But there
are a few fibers, of interest to us now, which do not run directly to
the visual cortex of the brain where we “see” the
images, but instead go into the mid-brain HH. These are the fibers
which measure the average light and make adjustment for the iris; or, if
the image looks foggy, they try to correct the lens; or, if there is a
double image, they try to adjust the eye for binocular
vision. At any
rate, they go through the mid-brain and feed back into the eye. At KK
are the muscles which run the accommodation of the lens, and at LL
another one that runs into the iris. The iris has two muscle systems.
One is a circular muscle LL which, when it is excited, pulls in and
closes down the iris; it acts very rapidly and the nerves are directly
connected from the brain through short axons into the iris. The opposite
muscles are radial muscles, so that, when the things get dark and the
circular muscle relaxes, these radial muscles pull out. Here we have, as
in many places in the body, a pair of muscles which work in opposite
directions, and in almost every such case the nerve systems which
control the two are very delicately adjusted, so that when signals are
sent in to tighten one, signals are automatically sent in to loosen the
other. The iris is a peculiar exception: the nerves which make the iris
contract are the ones we have already described, but the nerves which
make the iris expand come out from no one knows exactly where, go
down into the spinal cord back of the chest, into the thoracic sections,
out of the spinal cord, up through the neck ganglia, and all the way
around and back up into the head in order to run the other end of the
iris. In fact, the signal goes through a completely different nervous
system, not the central nervous system at all, but the sympathetic
nervous system, so it is a very strange way of making things go.
We have already emphasized another strange thing about the eye, that
the light-sensitive cells are on the wrong side, so that the light has
to go through several layers of other cells before it gets to the
receptors—it is built inside out! So some of the features are
wonderful and some are apparently stupid.
Fig. 36–4.The neural connections from the eyes to the visual cortex.
Figure 36–4 shows the connections of the eye to the part of
the brain which is most directly concerned with the visual process. The
optic nerve fibers run into a certain area just beyond DD, called the
lateral geniculate, whereupon they run out to a section of the brain
called the visual cortex. Notice that some of the
fibers from each eye are sent over to the other side of the brain, so
the picture formed is incomplete. The optic nerves from the left side of
the right eye run across the optic chiasma BB, while the ones on the
left side of the left eye come around and go this same way. So the left
side of the brain receives all the information which comes from the left
side of the eyeball of each eye, i.e., on the right side of the visual
field, while the right side of the brain sees the left side of the
visual field. This is the manner in which the information from each of
the two eyes is put together in order to tell how far away things are.
This is the system of binocular vision.
The connections between the retina and the visual cortex are interesting. If a spot in the retina is excised or destroyed
in any way, then the whole fiber will die, and we can thereby find out
where it is connected. It turns out that, essentially, the connections
are one to one—for each spot in the retina there is one spot in the
visual cortex—and spots that are very close
together in the retina are very close together in the visual
cortex. So the visual cortex
still represents the spatial arrangement of the rods and cones, but of course much distorted. Things
which are in the center of the field, which occupy a very small part of
the retina, are expanded over many, many cells in the visual
cortex. It is clear that it is useful to have
things which are originally close together, still close together. The
most remarkable aspect of the matter, however, is the following. The
place where one would think it would be most important to have things
close together would be right in the middle of the visual field. Believe
it or not, the up-and-down line in our visual field as we look at
something is of such a nature that the information from all the points
on the right side of that line is going into the left side of the brain,
and information from the points on the left side is going into the right
side of the brain, and the way this area is made, there is a cut right
down through the middle, so that the things that are very close together
right in the middle are very far apart in the brain! Somehow, the
information has to go from one side of the brain to the other through
some other channels, which is quite surprising.
The question of how this network ever gets “wired” together is very
interesting. The problem of how much is already wired and how much is
learned is an old one. It used to be thought long ago that perhaps it
does not have to be wired carefully at all, it is only just roughly
interconnected, and then, by experience, the young child learns that
when a thing is “up there” it produces some sensation in the
brain. (Doctors always tell us what the young child “feels,” but how
do they know what a child feels at the age of one?) The child,
at the age of one, supposedly sees that an object is “up there,”
gets a certain sensation, and learns to reach “there,” because when
he reaches “here,” it does not work. That approach probably is not
correct, because we already see that in many cases there are these
special detailed interconnections. More illuminating are some most
remarkable experiments done with a salamander. (Incidentally, with the
salamander there is a direct crossover connection, without the optic
chiasma, because the eyes are on each side of the head and have no
common area. Salamanders do not have binocular
vision.) The experiment
is this. We can cut the optic nerve in a salamander and the nerve will
grow out from the eyes again. Thousands and thousands of cell fibers
will thus re-establish themselves. Now, in the optic nerve the fibers
do not stay adjacent to each other—it is like a great, sloppily made
telephone cable, all the fibers twisting and turning, but when it gets
to the brain they are all sorted out again. When we cut the optic
nerve of the salamander, the interesting question is, will it ever get
straightened out? The answer is remarkable: yes. If we cut the optic
nerve of the salamander and it grows back, the salamander has good
visual acuity again. However, if we cut the optic nerve and turn
the eye upside down and let it grow back again, it has good visual
acuity all right, but it has a terrible error: when the salamander
sees a fly “up here,” it jumps at it “down there,” and it never
learns. Therefore there is some mysterious way by which the thousands
and thousands of fibers find their right places in the brain.
This problem of how much is wired in, and how much is not, is an
important problem in the theory of the development of creatures. The
answer is not known, but is being studied intensively.
The same experiment in the case of a goldfish shows that there is a
terrible knot, like a great scar or complication, in the optic nerve
where we cut it, but in spite of all this the fibers grow back to
their right places in the brain.
In order to do this, as they grow into the old channels of the optic
nerve they must make several decisions about the direction in which
they should grow. How do they do this? There seem to be chemical clues
that different fibers respond to differently. Think of the enormous
number of growing fibers, each of which is an individual differing in
some way from its neighbors; in responding to whatever the chemical
clues are, it responds in a unique enough way to find its proper place
for ultimate connection in the brain! This is an interesting—a
fantastic—thing. It is one of the great recently discovered
phenomena of biology and is undoubtedly connected to many older
unsolved problems of growth, organization, and development of
organisms, and particularly of embryos.
One other interesting phenomenon has to do with the motion of the
eye. The eyes must be moved in order to make the two images coincide
in different circumstances. These motions are of different kinds: one
is to follow something, which requires that both eyes must go in the
same direction, right or left, and the other is to point them toward
the same place at various distances away, which requires that they
must move oppositely. The nerves going into the muscles of the eye are
already wired up for just such purposes. There is one set of nerves
which will pull the muscles on the inside of one eye and the outside
of the other, and relax the opposite muscles, so that the two eyes
move together. There is another center where an excitation will cause
the eyes to move in toward each other from parallel. Either eye can be
turned out to the corner if the other eye moves toward the nose, but
it is impossible consciously or unconsciously to turn both eyes
out at the same time, not because there are no muscles,
but because there is no way to send a signal to turn both eyes out,
unless we have had an accident or there is something the matter, for
instance if a nerve has been cut. Although the muscles of one eye can
certainly steer that eye about, not even a Yogi is able to move
both eyes out freely under voluntary control, because there
does not seem to be any way to do it. We are already wired to a
certain extent. This is an important point, because most of the
earlier books on anatomy and psychology, and so on, do not appreciate
or do not emphasize the fact that we are so completely wired
already—they say that everything is just learned.
36–3The rod cells
Fig. 36–5.Electron micrograph of a rod cell.
Let us now examine in more detail what happens in the rod
cells. Figure 36–5 shows an electron micrograph of the
middle of a rod cell (the rod cell keeps going up out of the
field). There are layer after layer of plane structures, shown
magnified at the right, which contain the substance rhodopsin (visual
purple), the dye, or pigment, which produces the effects of vision in
the rods. The rhodopsin, which is the pigment, is a big protein which
contains a special group called retinene, which can be taken off the
protein, and which is, undoubtedly, the main cause of the absorption
of light. We do not understand the reason for the planes, but it is
very likely that there is some reason for holding all the rhodopsin
molecules parallel. The chemistry of the thing has been worked out to
a large extent, but there might be some physics to it. It may be that
all of the molecules are arranged in some kind of a row so that when
one is excited an electron which is generated, say, may run all the
way down to some place at the end to get the signal out, or
something. This subject is very important, and has not been worked
out. It is a field in which both biochemistry and solid state physics,
or something like it, will ultimately be used.
Fig. 36–6.The structure of retinene.
This kind of a structure, with layers, appears in other circumstances
where light is important, for example in the chloroplast in plants,
where the light causes photosynthesis. If we magnify those, we find
the same thing with almost the same kind of layers, but there we have
chlorophyll, of course, instead of retinene. The chemical form of
retinene is shown in Fig. 36–6. It has a series of
alternate double bonds along the side chain, which is characteristic
of nearly all strongly absorbing organic substances, like chlorophyll,
blood, and so on. This substance is impossible for human beings to
manufacture in their own cells—we have to eat it. So we eat it in
the form of a special substance, which is exactly the same as retinene
except that there is a hydrogen tied on the right end; it is called
vitamin A, and if we do not eat enough of it, we do not get a supply
of retinene, and the eye becomes what we call night blind,
because there is then not enough pigment in the rhodopsin to see with
the rods at night.
The reason why such a series of double bonds absorbs light very
strongly is also known. We may just give a hint: The alternating
series of double bonds is called a conjugated double bond; a
double bond means that there is an extra electron there, and this
extra electron is easily shifted to the right or left. When light
strikes this molecule, the electron of each double bond is shifted
over by one step. All the electrons in the whole chain shift, like a
string of dominoes falling over, and though each one moves only a
little distance (we would expect that, in a single atom, we could move
the electron only a little distance), the net effect is the same as
though the one at the end was moved over to the other end! It is the
same as though one electron went the whole distance back and forth,
and so, in this manner, we get a much stronger absorption under the
influence of the electric field, than if we could only move the
electron a distance which is associated with one atom. So, since it is
easy to move the electrons back and forth, retinene absorbs light very
strongly; that is the machinery of the physical-chemical end of it.
36–4The compound (insect) eye
Let us now return to biology. The human eye is not the only kind of
eye. In the vertebrates, almost all eyes are essentially like the
human eye. However, in the lower animals there are many other kinds of
eyes: eye spots, various eye cups, and other less sensitive things,
which we have no time to discuss. But there is one other highly
developed eye among the invertebrates, the compound eye of the
insect. (Most insects having large compound eyes also have various
additional simpler eyes as well.) A bee is an insect whose vision has
been studied very carefully. It is easy to study the properties of the
vision of bees because they are attracted to honey, and we can make
experiments in which we identify the honey by putting it on blue paper
or red paper, and see which one they come to. By this method some very
interesting things have been discovered about the vision of the bee.
In the first place, in trying to measure how acutely bees could see
the color difference between two pieces of “white” paper, some
researchers found they were not very good, and others found they were
fantastically good. Even if the two pieces of white paper were almost
exactly the same, the bees could still tell the difference. The
experimenters used zinc white for one piece of paper and lead white
for the other, and although these look exactly the same to us, the bee
could easily distinguish them, because they reflect a different amount
in the ultraviolet. In this way it was discovered that the bee’s eye
is sensitive over a wider range of the spectrum than is our own. Our
eye works from 70007000 angstroms to 40004000 angstroms, from red to
violet, but the bee’s can see down to 30003000 angstroms into the
ultraviolet!
This makes for a number of different interesting
effects. In the first place, bees can distinguish between many flowers
which to us look alike. Of course, we must realize that the colors of
flowers are not designed for our eyes, but for the bee; they
are signals to attract the bees to a specific flower. We all know that
there are many “white” flowers. Apparently white is not very
interesting to the bees, because it turns out that all of the white
flowers have different proportions of reflection in the
ultraviolet; they do not reflect one hundred percent of the
ultraviolet as would a true white. All the light is not coming back,
the ultraviolet is missing, and that is a color, just as, for us, if
the blue is missing, it comes out yellow. So, all the flowers are
colored for the bees. However, we also know that red cannot be seen by
bees. Thus we might expect that all red flowers should look black to
the bee. Not so! A careful study of red flowers shows, first, that
even with our own eye we can see that a great majority of red flowers
have a bluish tinge because they are mainly reflecting an additional
amount in the blue, which is the part that the bee sees. Furthermore,
experiments also show that flowers vary in their reflection of the
ultraviolet over different parts of the petals, and so on. So if we
could see the flowers as bees see them they would be even more
beautiful and varied!
It has been shown, however, that there are a few red flowers which do
not reflect in the blue or in the ultraviolet, and
would, therefore, appear black to the bee! This was of quite
some concern to the people who worry about this matter, because black
does not seem like an interesting color, since it is hard to tell from
a dirty old shadow. It actually turned out that these flowers were
not visited by bees, these are the flowers that are visited by
hummingbirds, and hummingbirds can see the red!
Another interesting aspect of the vision of the bee is that bees can
apparently tell the direction of the sun by looking at a patch of blue
sky, without seeing the sun itself. We cannot easily do this. If we
look out the window at the sky and see that it is blue, in which
direction is the sun? The bee can tell, because the bee is quite
sensitive to the polarization of light, and the scattered light
of the sky is polarized.2 There is still some
debate about how this sensitivity operates. Whether it is because the
reflections of the light are different in different circumstances, or
the bee’s eye is directly sensitive, is not yet
known.3
It is also said that the bee can notice flicker up to 200200 oscillations
per second, while we see it only up to 2020. The motions
of bees in the hives are very quick; the feet move and the wings
vibrate, but it is very hard for us to see these motions with our
eye. However, if we could see more rapidly we would be able to see the
motion. It is probably very important to the bee that its eye has such
a rapid response.

eye).
Now let us discuss the visual acuity we could expect from the bee. The
eye of a bee is a compound eye, and it is made of a large number of
special cells called ommatidia, which are arranged conically on
the surface of a sphere (roughly) on the outside of the bee’s
head. Figure 36–7 shows a picture of one such
ommatidium. At the top there is a transparent area, a kind of
“lens,” but actually it is more like a filter or light pipe to make
the light come down along the narrow fiber, which is where the
absorption presumably occurs. Out of the other end of it comes the
nerve fiber. The central fiber is surrounded on its sides by six cells
which, in fact, have secreted the fiber. That is enough description
for our purposes; the point is that it is a conical thing and many can
fit next to each other all over the surface of the eye of the bee.
Fig. 36–8.Schematic view of packing of ommatidia in the eye of a bee.
Now let us discuss the resolution of the eye of the bee. If we draw
lines (Fig. 36–8) to represent the ommatidia on the
surface, which we suppose is a sphere of radius rr, we may actually
calculate how wide each ommatidium is by using our brains, and
assuming that evolution is as clever as we are! If we have a very
large ommatidium we do not have much resolution. That is, one cell
gets a piece of information from one direction, and the adjacent cell
gets a piece of information from another direction, and so on, and the
bee cannot see things in between very well. So the uncertainty of
visual acuity in the eye will surely correspond to an angle, the angle
of the end of the ommatidium relative to the center of curvature of
the eye. (The eye cells, of course, exist only at the surface of the
sphere; inside that is the head of the bee.) This angle, from one
ommatidium to the next, is, of course, the diameter of the ommatidia
divided by the radius of the eye surface:
Δθg=δ/r.(36.1)(36.1)Δθg=δ/r.
So, we may say, “The finer we make the δδ, the more the visual
acuity. So why doesn’t the bee just use very, very fine ommatidia?”
Answer: We know enough physics to realize that if we are trying
to get light down into a narrow slot, we cannot see accurately in a
given direction because of the diffraction effect. The light that
comes from several directions can enter and, due to diffraction, we
will get light coming in at angle ΔθdΔθd such that
Δθd=λ/δ.(36.2)(36.2)Δθd=λ/δ.
Now we see that if we make the δδ too small, then each ommatidium does not
look in only one direction, because of diffraction! If we make them too big,
each one sees in a definite direction, but there are not enough of them to get a
good view of the scene. So we adjust the distance δδ in order to make
minimal the total effect of these two. If we add the two together, and find the
place where the sum has a minimum (Fig. 36–9), we find that
d(Δθg+Δθd)dδ=0=1r−λδ2,(36.3)(36.3)d(Δθg+Δθd)dδ=0=1r−λδ2,
which gives us a distance
δ=λr−−√.(36.4)(36.4)δ=λr.
If we guess that rr is about 33 millimeters, take the light that the
bee sees as 40004000 angstroms, and put the two together and take the
square root, we find
δ=(3×10−3×4×10−7)1/2 m=3.5×10−5 m=35 μm.(36.5)δ=(3×10−3×4×10−7)1/2 m(36.5)=3.5×10−5 m=35 μm.
The book says the diameter is 3030 μμm, so that is rather good
agreement!
So, apparently, it really works, and we can understand
what determines the size of the bee’s eye! It is also easy to put the
above number back in and find out how good the bee’s eye actually is
in angular resolution; it is very poor relative to our own. We can see
things that are thirty times smaller in apparent size than the bee;
the bee has a rather fuzzy out-of-focus image relative to what we can
see. Nevertheless it is all right, and it is the best they can do. We
might ask why the bees do not develop a good eye like our own, with a
lens and so on. There are several interesting reasons. In the first
place, the bee is too small; if it had an eye like ours, but on his
scale, the opening would be about 3030 μμm in size and diffraction
would be so important that it would not be able to see very well
anyway. The eye is not good if it is too small. Secondly, if it were
as big as the bee’s head, then the eye would occupy the whole head of
the bee. The beauty of the compound eye is that it takes up no space,
it is just a very thin layer on the surface of the bee. So when we
argue that they should have done it our way, we must remember that
they had their own problems!
Fig. 36–9.The optimum size for an ommatidium is δmδm.
36–5Other eyes
Besides the bees, many other animals can see color. Fish, butterflies,
birds, and reptiles can see color, but it is believed that most
mammals cannot. The primates can see color. The birds certainly see
color, and that accounts for the colors of birds. There would be no
point in having such brilliantly colored males if the females could
not notice it! That is, the evolution of the sexual “whatever it is”
that the birds have is a result of the female being able to see
color. So next time we look at a peacock and think of what a brilliant
display of gorgeous color it is, and how delicate all the colors are,
and what a wonderful aesthetic sense it takes to appreciate all that,
we should not compliment the peacock, but should compliment the visual
acuity and aesthetic sense of the peahen, because that is what
has generated the beautiful scene!
Fig. 36–10.The eye of an octopus.
All invertebrates have poorly developed eyes or compound eyes, but all
the vertebrates have eyes very similar to our own, with one
exception. If we consider the highest form of animal, we usually say,
“Here we are!,” but if we take a less prejudiced point of view and
restrict ourselves to the invertebrates, so that we cannot include
ourselves, and ask what is the highest invertebrate animal, most
zoologists agree that the octopus is the highest animal! It is
very interesting that, besides the development of its brain and its
reactions and so on, which are rather good for an invertebrate, it has
also developed, independently, a different eye. It is not a compound
eye or an eye spot—it has a cornea, it has lids, it has
an iris, it has a lens, it has two regions of water, it has a retina behind.
It is essentially the same as the eye of the vertebrates! It is a remarkable
example of a coincidence in evolution where nature has twice
discovered the same solution to a problem, with one slight
improvement. In the octopus it also turns out, amazingly, that the
retina is a piece of the brain that has come out in the same way in
its embryonic development as is true for vertebrates, but the
interesting thing which is different is that the cells which are
sensitive to light are on the inside, and the cells which do
the calculation are in back of them, rather than “inside out,” as in
our eye. So we see, at least, that there is no good reason for its
being inside out. The other time nature tried it, she got it
straightened out! (See Fig. 36–10.) The biggest eyes in
the world are those of the giant squid; they have been found up to
1515 inches in diameter!
36–6Neurology of vision
One of the main points of our subject is the interconnection of
information from one part of the eye to the other. Let us consider the
compound eye of the horseshoe crab, on which considerable
experimentation has been done. First of all, we must appreciate what
kind of information can come along nerves. A nerve carries a kind of
disturbance which has an electrical effect that is easy to detect, a
kind of wavelike disturbance which runs down the nerve and produces an
effect at the other end: a long piece of the nerve cell, called the
axon, carries the information along, and a certain kind of impulse,
called a “spike,” goes along if it is excited at one end. When one
spike goes down the nerve, another cannot immediately follow. All the
spikes are of the same size, so it is not that we get higher
spikes when the thing is more strongly excited, but that we get
more spikes per second. The size of the spike is
determined by the fiber. It is important to appreciate this in order
to see what happens next.

Figure 36–11(a) shows the compound eye of the horseshoe
crab; it is not very much of an eye, it has only about a thousand
ommatidia. Figure 36–11(b) is a cross section through the
system; one can see the ommatidia, with the nerve fibers that run out
of them and go into the brain. But note that even in a horseshoe crab
there are little interconnections. They are much less elaborate than
in the human eye, and it gives us a chance to study a simpler example.
Let us now look at the experiments which have been done by putting
fine electrodes into the optic nerve of the horseshoe crab, and
shining light on only one of the ommatidia, which is easy to do with
lenses. If we turn a light on at some instant t0t0, and measure the
electrical pulses that come out, we find that there is a slight delay
and then a rapid series of discharges which gradually slow down to a
uniform rate, as shown in Fig. 36–12(a). When the light
goes out, the discharge stops. Now it is very interesting that if,
while our amplifier is connected to this same nerve fiber, we shine
light on a different ommatidium nothing happens; no signal.
Fig. 36–12.The response to light of the nerve fibers of the eye of the
horseshoe crab.
Now we do another experiment: we shine the light on the original
ommatidium and get the same response, but if we now turn light on
another one nearby as well, the pulses are interrupted briefly and
then run at a much lower rate (Fig. 36–12b). The rate of
one is inhibited by the impulses which are coming out of the other! In
other words, each nerve fiber carries the information from one
ommatidium, but the amount that it carries is inhibited by the signals
from the others. So, for example, if the whole eye is more or less
uniformly illuminated, the information coming from any one ommatidium
will be relatively weak, because it is inhibited by so many. In fact
the inhibition is additive—if we shine light on several nearby
ommatidia the inhibition is very great. The inhibition is greater when
the ommatidia are closer, and if the ommatidia are far enough away
from one another, inhibition is practically zero. So it is additive
and depends on the distance; here is a first example of information
from different parts of the eye being combined in the eye itself. We
can see, perhaps, if we think about it awhile, that this is a device
to enhance contrast at the edges of objects, because if a part
of the scene is light and a part is black, then the ommatidia in the
lighted area give impulses that are inhibited by all the other light
in the neighborhood, so it is relatively weak. On the other hand, an
ommatidium at the boundary which is given a “white” impulse is also
inhibited by others in the neighborhood, but there are not as many of
them, since some are black; the net signal is therefore stronger. The
result would be a curve, something like that of Fig. 36–13.
The crab will see an enhancement of the contour.
Fig. 36–13.The net response of horseshoe crab ommatidia near a sharp
change in illumination.
The fact that there is an enhancement of contours has long been known;
in fact it is a remarkable thing that has been commented on by
psychologists many times. In order to draw an object, we have only to
draw its outline. How used we are to looking at pictures that have
only the outline! What is the outline? The outline is only the edge
difference between light and dark or one color and another. It is not
something definite. It is not, believe it or not, that every object
has a line around it! There is no such line. It is only in our own
psychological makeup that there is a line; we are beginning to
understand the reasons why the “line” is enough of a clue to get the
whole thing. Presumably our own eye works in some similar
manner—much more complicated, but similar.
Finally, we shall briefly describe the more elaborate work, the
beautiful, advanced work that has been done on the frog. Doing a
corresponding experiment on a frog, by putting very fine, beautifully
built needlelike probes into the optic nerve of a frog, one can obtain
the signals that are going along one particular axon and, just as in
the case of the horseshoe crab, we find that the information does not
depend on just one spot in the eye, but is a sum of information over
several spots.

The most recent picture of the operation of the frog’s eye is the
following. One can find four different kinds of optic nerve fibers, in
the sense that there are four different kinds of responses. These
experiments were not done by shining on-and-off impulses of light,
because that is not what a frog sees. A frog just sits there and his
eyes never move, unless the lily pad is flopping back and forth, and
in that case his eyes wobble just right so that the image stays
put. He does not turn his eyes. If anything moves in his field of
vision, like a little bug (he has to be able to see something small
moving in the fixed background), it turns out that there are four
different kinds of fibers which discharge, whose properties are
summarized in Table 36–1. Sustained edge detection,
nonerasable, means that if we bring an object with an edge into the
field of view of the frog, then there are a lot of impulses in this
particular fiber while the object is moving, but they die down to a
sustained impulse that continues as long as the edge is there, even if
it is standing still. If we turn out the light, the impulses stop. If
we turn it on again while the edge is still in view, they start
again. They are not erasable. Another kind of fiber is very similar,
except that if the edge is straight it does not work. It must be a
convex edge with dark behind it! How complicated must be the system of
interconnections in the retina of the eye of the frog in order for it
to understand that a convex surface has moved in! Furthermore,
although this fiber does sustain somewhat, it does not sustain as long
as the other, and if we turn out the light and turn it on again it
does not build up again. It depends on the moving in of the
convex surface. The eye sees it move in and remembers that it is
there, but if we merely turn out the light for a moment, it simply
forgets it and no longer sees it.
Another example is change-in-contrast detection. If there is an edge
moving in or out there are pulses, but if the thing stands still there
are no pulses at all.
Then there is a dimming detector. If the light intensity is going down
it creates pulses, but if it stays down or stays up, the impulse
stops; it only works while the light is dimming.
Then, finally, there are a few fibers which are dark detectors—a
most amazing thing—they fire all the time! If we increase the light,
they fire less rapidly, but all the time. If we decrease the light,
they fire more rapidly, all the time. In the dark they fire like mad,
perpetually saying, “It is dark! It is dark! It is dark!”
Now these responses seem to be rather complicated to classify, and we
might wonder whether perhaps the experiments are being
misinterpreted. But it is very interesting that these same classes are
very clearly separated in the anatomy of the frog! By other
measurements, after these responses had been classified
(afterwards, that is what is important about this), it was
discovered that the speed of the signals on the different
fibers was not the same, so here was another, independent way to check
which kind of a fiber we have found!
Another interesting question is from how big an area is one particular
fiber making its calculations? The answer is different for the
different classes.
Fig. 36–14.The tectum of a frog.
Figure 36–14 shows the surface of the so-called tectum of
a frog, where the nerves come into the brain from the optic nerve. All
the nerve fibers coming in from the optic nerve make connections in
various layers of the tectum. This layered structure is analogous to
the retina; that is partly why we know that the brain and retina are
very similar. Now, by taking an electrode and moving it down in
succession through the layers, we can find out which kinds of optic
nerves end where, and the beautiful and wonderful result is that the
different kinds of fibers end in different layers! The first ones end
in number 11 type, the second in number 22, the threes and fives end
in the same place, and deepest of all is number four. (What a
coincidence, they got the numbers almost in the right order! No, that
is why they numbered them that way, the first paper had the numbers in
a different order!)
We may briefly summarize what we have just learned this way: There are
three pigments, presumably. There may be many different kinds of
receptor cells containing the three pigments in different proportions,
but there are many cross connections which may permit additions and
subtractions through addition and reinforcement in the nervous
system. So before we really understand color vision, we will have to
understand the final sensation. This subject is still an open one, but
these researches with microelectrodes and so on will perhaps
ultimately give us more information on how we see color.

The human eye also has a slight
sensitivity to the polarization of light, and one can learn to
tell the direction of the sun! The phenomenon that is involved here is
called Haidinger’s brush; it is a faint, yellowish
hourglass-like pattern seen at the center of the visual field when one
looks at a broad, featureless expanse using polarizing glasses. It can
also be seen in the blue sky without polarizing glasses if one rotates
his head back and forth about the axis of vision.
