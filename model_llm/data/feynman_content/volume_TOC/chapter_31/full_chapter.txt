31The Origin of the Refractive Index
31–1The index of refraction
We have said before that light goes slower in water than in air, and
slower, slightly, in air than in vacuum. This effect is described by
the index of refraction nn. Now we would like to understand how such
a slower velocity could come about. In particular, we should try to
see what the relation is to some physical assumptions, or statements,
we made earlier, which were the following:
That the total electric field in any physical circumstance can
always be represented by the sum of the fields from all the charges in
the universe.
That the field from a single charge is given by its acceleration
evaluated with a retardation at the speed cc, always (for the
radiation field).
But, for a piece of glass, you might think: “Oh, no, you should
modify all this. You should say it is retarded at the speed c/nc/n.”
That, however, is not right, and we have to understand why it is not.
It is approximately true that light or any electrical wave
does appear to travel at the speed c/nc/n through a material
whose index of refraction is nn, but the fields are still produced by
the motions of all the charges—including the charges moving
in the material—and with these basic contributions of the field
travelling at the ultimate velocity cc. Our problem is to understand
how the apparently slower velocity comes about.
Fig. 31–1.Electric waves passing through a layer of transparent
material.
We shall try to understand the effect in a very simple case. A source
which we shall call “the external source” is placed a large
distance away from a thin plate of transparent material, say glass. We
inquire about the field at a large distance on the opposite side of
the plate. The situation is illustrated by the diagram of
Fig. 31–1, where SS and PP are imagined to be very far
away from the plate. According to the principles we have stated earlier,
an electric field anywhere that is far from all moving charges is the
(vector) sum of the fields produced by the external source (at SS)
and the fields produced by each of the charges in the
plate of glass, every one with its proper retardation at the
velocity cc. Remember that the contribution of each charge is not
changed by the presence of the other charges. These are our basic
principles. The field at PP can be written thus:
E=∑all chargesEeach charge(31.1)(31.1)E=∑all chargesEeach charge
or
E=Es+∑all other chargesEeach charge,(31.2)(31.2)E=Es+∑all other chargesEeach charge,
where EsEs is the field due to the source alone and would be
precisely the field at PP if there were no material
present. We expect the field at PP to be different from EsEs if
there are any other moving charges.
Why should there be charges moving in the glass? We know that all
material consists of atoms which contain electrons. When the electric
field of the source acts on these atoms it drives the electrons
up and down, because it exerts a force on the electrons. And moving
electrons generate a field—they constitute new radiators. These new
radiators are related to the source SS, because they are driven by
the field of the source. The total field is not just the field of the
source SS, but it is modified by the additional contribution from the
other moving charges. This means that the field is not the same as the
one which was there before the glass was there, but is modified, and
it turns out that it is modified in such a way that the field inside
the glass appears to be moving at a different speed. That is the idea
which we would like to work out quantitatively.
Now this is, in the exact case, pretty complicated, because although
we have said that all the other moving charges are driven by the
source field, that is not quite true. If we think of a particular
charge, it feels not only the source, but like anything else in the
world, it feels all of the charges that are moving. It feels,
in particular, the charges that are moving somewhere else in the
glass. So the total field which is acting on a particular
charge is a combination of the fields from the other charges,
whose motions depend on what this particular charge is doing!
You can see that it would take a complicated set of equations to get
the complete and exact formula. It is so complicated that we postpone
this problem until next year.
Instead we shall work out a very simple case in order to understand
all the physical principles very clearly. We take a circumstance in
which the effects from the other atoms are very small relative to the
effects from the source. In other words, we take a material in which
the total field is not modified very much by the motion of the other
charges. That corresponds to a material in which the index of
refraction is very close to 11, which will happen, for example, if
the density of the atoms is very low. Our calculation will be valid
for any case in which the index is for any reason very close
to 11. In this way we shall avoid the complications of the most general,
complete solution.
Incidentally, you should notice that there is another effect caused by
the motion of the charges in the plate. These charges will also
radiate waves back toward the source SS. This backward-going field is
the light we see reflected from the surfaces of transparent
materials. It does not come from just the surface. The backward
radiation comes from everywhere in the interior, but it turns out that
the total effect is equivalent to a reflection from the
surfaces. These reflection effects are beyond our approximation at the
moment because we shall be limited to a calculation for a material
with an index so close to 11 that very little light is reflected.
Fig. 31–2.Relation between refraction and velocity change.
Before we proceed with our study of how the index of refraction comes
about, we should understand that all that is required to understand
refraction is to understand why the apparent wave velocity is
different in different materials. The bending of light rays
comes about just because the effective speed of the waves is
different in the materials. To remind you how that comes about we have
drawn in Fig. 31–2 several successive crests of an
electric wave which arrives from a vacuum onto the surface of a block
of glass. The arrow perpendicular to the wave crests indicates the
direction of travel of the wave. Now all oscillations in the wave must
have the same frequency. (We have seen that driven oscillations
have the same frequency as the driving source.) This means, also, that
the wave crests for the waves on both sides of the surface must have
the same spacing along the surface because they must travel
together, so that a charge sitting at the boundary will feel only one
frequency. The shortest distance between crests of the wave,
however, is the wavelength which is the velocity divided by the
frequency. On the vacuum side it is λ0=2πc/ωλ0=2πc/ω, and
on the other side it is λ=2πv/ωλ=2πv/ω or 2πc/ωn2πc/ωn, if v=c/nv=c/n is the velocity of the wave. From the figure we can
see that the only way for the waves to “fit” properly at the
boundary is for the waves in the material to be travelling at a
different angle with respect to the surface. From the geometry of the
figure you can see that for a “fit” we must have λ0/sinθ0=λ/sinθλ0/sin⁡θ0=λ/sin⁡θ, or sinθ0/sinθ=nsin⁡θ0/sin⁡θ=n,
which is Snell’s law. We shall, for the
rest of our discussion, consider only why light has an effective speed
of c/nc/n in material of index nn, and no longer worry, in this chapter,
about the bending of the light direction.
We go back now to the situation shown in Fig. 31–1. We
see that what we have to do is to calculate the field produced at PP
by all the oscillating charges in the glass plate. We shall call this
part of the field EaEa, and it is just the sum written as the second
term in Eq. (31.2). When we add it to the term EsEs, due
to the source, we will have the total field at PP.
This is probably the most complicated thing that we are going to do
this year, but it is complicated only in that there are many pieces
that have to be put together; each piece, however, is very
simple. Unlike other derivations where we say, “Forget the
derivation, just look at the answer!,” in this case we do not need
the answer so much as the derivation. In other words, the thing to
understand now is the physical machinery for the production of the
index.
To see where we are going, let us first find out what the “correction
field” EaEa would have to be if the total field at PP is going to
look like radiation from the source that is slowed down while passing
through the thin plate. If the plate had no effect on it, the field of
a wave travelling to the right (along the zz-axis) would be
Es=E0cosω(t−z/c)(31.3)(31.3)Es=E0cos⁡ω(t−z/c)
or, using the exponential notation,
Es=E0eiω(t−z/c).(31.4)(31.4)Es=E0eiω(t−z/c).
Now what would happen if the wave travelled more slowly in going
through the plate? Let us call the thickness of the plate ΔzΔz. If the plate were not there the wave would travel the
distance ΔzΔz in the time Δz/cΔz/c. But if it appears to travel at
the speed c/nc/n then it should take the longer time nΔz/cnΔz/c or
the additional time Δt=(n−1)Δz/cΔt=(n−1)Δz/c. After
that it would continue to travel at the speed cc again. We can take
into account the extra delay in getting through the plate by
replacing tt in Eq. (31.4) by (t−Δt)(t−Δt) or by [t−(n−1)Δz/c][t−(n−1)Δz/c]. So the wave after insertion of the plate should be
written
Eafter plate=E0eiω[t−(n−1)Δz/c−z/c].(31.5)(31.5)Eafter plate=E0eiω[t−(n−1)Δz/c−z/c].
We can also write this equation as
Eafter plate=e−iω(n−1)Δz/cE0eiω(t−z/c),(31.6)(31.6)Eafter plate=e−iω(n−1)Δz/cE0eiω(t−z/c),
which says that the wave after the plate is obtained from the wave
which could exist without the plate, i.e., from EsEs, by multiplying
by the factor e−iω(n−1)Δz/ce−iω(n−1)Δz/c. Now we know that
multiplying an oscillating function like eiωteiωt by a
factor eiθeiθ just says that we change the phase of the oscillation by
the angle θθ, which is, of course, what the extra delay in
passing through the thickness ΔzΔz has done. It has retarded the
phase by the amount ω(n−1)Δz/cω(n−1)Δz/c (retarded, because of
the minus sign in the exponent).
We have said earlier that the plate should add a field EaEa to
the original field Es=E0eiω(t−z/c)Es=E0eiω(t−z/c), but we have found
instead that the effect of the plate is to multiply the field
by a factor which shifts its phase. However, that is really all right
because we can get the same result by adding a suitable complex
number. It is particularly easy to find the right number to add in the
case that ΔzΔz is small, for you will remember that if xx is a
small number then exex is nearly equal to (1+x)(1+x). We can write,
therefore,
e−iω(n−1)Δz/c≈1−iω(n−1)Δz/c.(31.7)(31.7)e−iω(n−1)Δz/c≈1−iω(n−1)Δz/c.
Using this approximation in Eq. (31.6), we have
Eafter plate=icE0eiω(t−z/c)Es−iω(n−1)ΔzcE0eiω(t−z/c)Ea.(31.8)(31.8)Eafter plate=icE0eiω(t−z/c)⏟Es−iω(n−1)ΔzcE0eiω(t−z/c)⏟Ea.
The first term is just the field from the source, and the second term
must just be equal to EaEa, the field produced to the right of the
plate by the oscillating charges of the plate—expressed here in
terms of the index of refraction nn, and depending, of course, on the
strength of the wave from the source.
What we have been doing is easily visualized if we look at the complex
number diagram in Fig. 31–3. We first draw the
number EsEs (we chose some values for zz and tt so that EsEs comes out
horizontal, but this is not necessary). The delay due to slowing down
in the plate would delay the phase of this number, that is, it would
rotate EsEs through a negative angle. But this is equivalent to
adding the small vector EaEa at roughly right angles to EsEs. But
that is just what the factor −i−i means in the second term of
Eq. (31.8). It says that if EsEs is real, then EaEa is
negative imaginary or that, in general, EsEs and EaEa make a right
angle.
Fig. 31–3.Diagram for the transmitted wave at a particular tt and zz.
31–2The field due to the material
We now have to ask: Is the field EaEa obtained in the second term of
Eq. (31.8) the kind we would expect from oscillating
charges in the plate? If we can show that it is, we will then have
calculated what the index nn should be! [Since nn is the only
nonfundamental number in Eq. (31.8).] We turn now to
calculating what field EaEa the charges in the material will
produce. (To help you keep track of the many symbols we have used up
to now, and will be using in the rest of our calculation, we have put
them all together in Table 31–1.)

If the source SS (of Fig. 31–1) is far off to the left,
then the field EsEs will have the same phase everywhere on the plate,
so we can write that in the neighborhood of the plate
Es=E0eiω(t−z/c).(31.9)(31.9)Es=E0eiω(t−z/c).
Right at the plate, where z=0z=0, we will have
Es=E0eiωt (at the plate).(31.10)(31.10)Es=E0eiωt (at the plate).
Each of the electrons in the atoms of the plate will feel this
electric field and will be driven up and down (we assume the direction
of E0E0 is vertical) by the electric force qEqE. To find what motion
we expect for the electrons, we will assume that the atoms are little
oscillators, that is, that the electrons are fastened elastically to
the atoms, which means that if a force is applied to an electron its
displacement from its normal position will be proportional to the
force.
You may think that this is a funny model of an atom if you have heard
about electrons whirling around in orbits. But that is just an
oversimplified picture. The correct picture of an atom, which is given
by the theory of wave mechanics, says that, so far as problems
involving light are concerned, the electrons behave as though they
were held by springs. So we shall suppose that the electrons have a
linear restoring force which, together with their mass mm, makes them
behave like little oscillators, with a resonant
frequency ω0ω0. We have already studied such oscillators, and we know that
the equation of their motion is written this way:
m(d2xdt2+ω20x)=F,(31.11)(31.11)m(d2xdt2+ω02x)=F,
where FF is the driving force.
For our problem, the driving force comes from the electric field of
the wave from the source, so we should use
F=qeEs=qeE0eiωt,(31.12)(31.12)F=qeEs=qeE0eiωt,
where qeqe is the electric charge on the electron and for EsEs we
use the expression Es=E0eiωtEs=E0eiωt from (31.10). Our
equation of motion for the electron is then
m(d2xdt2+ω20x)=qeE0eiωt.(31.13)(31.13)m(d2xdt2+ω02x)=qeE0eiωt.
We have solved this equation before, and we know that the solution is
x=x0eiωt,(31.14)(31.14)x=x0eiωt,
where, by substituting in (31.13), we find that
x0=qeE0m(ω20−ω2),(31.15)(31.15)x0=qeE0m(ω02−ω2),
so that
x=qeE0m(ω20−ω2)eiωt.(31.16)(31.16)x=qeE0m(ω02−ω2)eiωt.
We have what we needed to know—the motion of the electrons in the
plate. And it is the same for every electron, except that the mean
position (the “zero” of the motion) is, of course, different for
each electron.
Now we are ready to find the field EaEa that these atoms produce at
the point PP, because we have already worked out (at the end of
Chapter 30) what field is produced by a sheet of charges
that all move together. Referring back to Eq. (30.19), we
see that the field EaEa at PP is just a negative constant times the
velocity of the charges retarded in time by the amount z/cz/c.
Differentiating xx in Eq. (31.16) to get the
velocity, and sticking in the retardation [or just putting x0x0 from
(31.15) into (30.18)] yields
Ea=−ηqe2ϵ0c[iωqeE0m(ω20−ω2)eiω(t−z/c)].(31.17)(31.17)Ea=−ηqe2ϵ0c[iωqeE0m(ω02−ω2)eiω(t−z/c)].
Just as we expected, the driven motion of the electrons produced an
extra wave which travels to the right (that is what the
factor eiω(t−z/c)eiω(t−z/c) says), and the amplitude of this wave is
proportional to the number of atoms per unit area in the plate (the
factor ηη) and also proportional to the strength of the source
field (the factor E0E0). Then there are some factors which depend on
the atomic properties (qeqe, mm, and ω0ω0), as we should
expect.
The most important thing, however, is that this
formula (31.17) for EaEa looks very much like the expression
for EaEa that we got in Eq. (31.8) by saying that the
original wave was delayed in passing through a material with an index of
refraction nn. The two expressions will, in fact, be identical if
(n−1)Δz=ηq2e2ϵ0m(ω20−ω2).(31.18)(31.18)(n−1)Δz=ηqe22ϵ0m(ω02−ω2).
Notice that both sides are proportional to ΔzΔz, since ηη,
which is the number of atoms per unit area, is equal
to NΔzNΔz, where NN is the number of atoms per unit volume
of the plate. Substituting NΔzNΔz for ηη and cancelling the
ΔzΔz, we get our main result, a formula for the index of
refraction in terms of the properties of the atoms of the
material—and of the frequency of the light:
n=1+Nq2e2ϵ0m(ω20−ω2).(31.19)(31.19)n=1+Nqe22ϵ0m(ω02−ω2).
This equation gives the “explanation” of the index of refraction
that we wished to obtain.
31–3Dispersion
Notice that in the above process we have obtained something very
interesting. For we have not only a number for the index of refraction
which can be computed from the basic atomic quantities, but we have
also learned how the index of refraction should vary with the
frequency ωω of the light. This is something we would never
understand from the simple statement that “light travels slower in a
transparent material.” We still have the problem, of course, of
knowing how many atoms per unit volume there are, and what is their
natural frequency ω0ω0. We do not know this just yet, because it
is different for every different material, and we cannot get a general
theory of that now. Formulation of a general theory of the properties
of different substances—their natural frequencies, and so on—is
possible only with quantum atomic mechanics. Also, different materials
have different properties and different indexes, so we cannot expect,
anyway, to get a general formula for the index which will apply to all
substances.
However, we shall discuss the formula we have obtained, in various
possible circumstances. First of all, for most ordinary gases (for
instance, for air, most colorless gases, hydrogen, helium, and so on)
the natural frequencies of the electron oscillators correspond to
ultraviolet light. These frequencies are higher than the frequencies
of visible light, that is, ω0ω0 is much larger than ωω of
visible light, and to a first approximation, we can disregard
ω2ω2 in comparison with ω20ω02. Then we find that the
index is nearly constant. So for a gas, the index is nearly
constant. This is also true for most other transparent substances,
like glass. If we look at our expression a little more closely,
however, we notice that as ωω rises, taking a little bit more
away from the denominator, the index also rises. So nn rises slowly
with frequency. The index is higher for blue light than for red
light. That is the reason why a prism bends the light more in the blue
than in the red.
The phenomenon that the index depends upon the frequency is called the
phenomenon of dispersion, because it is the basis of the fact
that light is “dispersed” by a prism into a spectrum. The equation
for the index of refraction as a function of frequency is called a
dispersion equation. So we have obtained a
dispersion equation. (In the past few years “dispersion equations”
have been finding a new use in the theory of elementary particles.)
Our dispersion equation suggests other interesting effects. If we have
a natural frequency ω0ω0 which lies in the visible region, or if
we measure the index of refraction of a material like glass in the
ultraviolet, where ωω gets near ω0ω0, we see that at
frequencies very close to the natural frequency the index can get
enormously large, because the denominator can go to zero. Next,
suppose that ωω is greater than ω0ω0. This would occur,
for example, if we take a material like glass, say, and shine x-ray
radiation on it. In fact, since many materials which are opaque to
visible light, like graphite for instance, are transparent to
x-rays, we can also talk about the index of refraction of
carbon for x-rays. All the natural frequencies of the
carbon atoms would be much lower than the frequency we are using in the
x-rays, since
x-ray radiation has a very high
frequency. The index of refraction is that given by our dispersion
equation if we set ω0ω0 equal to zero (we neglect ω20ω02 in
comparison with ω2ω2).
A similar situation would occur if we beam radiowaves (or light) on a
gas of free electrons. In the upper atmosphere electrons are liberated
from their atoms by ultraviolet light from the sun and they sit up
there as free electrons. For free electrons ω0=0ω0=0 (there is
no elastic restoring force). Setting ω0=0ω0=0 in our dispersion
equation yields the correct formula for the index of refraction for
radiowaves in the stratosphere, where NN is now to represent the
density of free electrons (number per unit volume) in the
stratosphere. But let us look again at the equation, if we beam
x-rays on matter, or radiowaves
(or any electric waves) on free electrons the
term (ω20−ω2)(ω02−ω2) becomes negative, and we obtain the
result that nn is less than one. That means that the effective
speed of the waves in the substance is faster than cc! Can that
be correct?
It is correct. In spite of the fact that it is said that you cannot
send signals any faster than the speed of light, it is nevertheless
true that the index of refraction of materials at a particular
frequency can be either greater or less than 11. This just means that
the phase shift which is produced by the scattered light can be
either positive or negative. It can be shown, however, that the speed
at which you can send a signal is not determined by the index
at one frequency, but depends on what the index is at many
frequencies. What the index tells us is the speed at which the
nodes (or crests) of the wave travel. The node of a wave
is not a signal by itself. In a perfect wave, which has no modulations
of any kind, i.e., which is a steady oscillation, you cannot really
say when it “starts,” so you cannot use it for a timing signal. In
order to send a signal you have to change the wave somehow,
make a notch in it, make it a little bit fatter or thinner. That means
that you have to have more than one frequency in the wave, and it can
be shown that the speed at which signals travel is not
dependent upon the index alone, but upon the way that the index
changes with the frequency. This subject we must also delay (until
Chapter 48). Then we will calculate for you the actual
speed of signals through such a piece of glass, and you will
see that it will not be faster than the speed of light, although the
nodes, which are mathematical points, do travel faster than the speed
of light.
Just to give a slight hint as to how that happens, you will note that
the real difficulty has to do with the fact that the responses of the
charges are opposite to the field, i.e., the sign has gotten
reversed. Thus in our expression for xx (Eq. 31.16) the
displacement of the charge is in the direction opposite to the driving
field, because (ω20−ω2)(ω02−ω2) is negative for small
ω0ω0. The formula says that when the electric field is pulling
in one direction, the charge is moving in the opposite direction.
How does the charge happen to be going in the opposite direction? It
certainly does not start off in the opposite direction when the field
is first turned on. When the motion first starts there is a transient,
which settles down after awhile, and only then is the phase of
the oscillation of the charge opposite to the driving field. And it is
then that the phase of the transmitted field can appear to be
advanced with respect to the source wave. It is this
advance in phase which is meant when we say that the “phase
velocity” or velocity of the nodes is greater than cc. In
Fig. 31–4 we give a schematic idea of how the waves might
look for a case where the wave is suddenly turned on (to make a signal).
You will see from the diagram that the signal (i.e., the
start of the wave) is not earlier for the wave which ends
up with an advance in phase.
Fig. 31–4.Wave “signals.”
Let us now look again at our dispersion equation. We should remark
that our analysis of the refractive index gives a result that is
somewhat simpler than you would actually find in nature. To be
completely accurate we must add some refinements. First, we should
expect that our model of the atomic oscillator should have some
damping force (otherwise once started it would oscillate forever, and
we do not expect that to happen). We have worked out before
(Eq. 23.8) the motion of a damped oscillator and the result
is that the denominator in Eq. (31.16), and therefore
in (31.19), is changed from (ω20−ω2)(ω02−ω2)
to (ω20−ω2+iγω)(ω02−ω2+iγω), where γγ is the damping
coefficient.
We need a second modification to take into account the fact that there
are several resonant frequencies for a particular kind of atom. It is
easy to fix up our dispersion equation by imagining that there are
several different kinds of oscillators, but that each oscillator acts
separately, and so we simply add the contributions of all the
oscillators. Let us say that there are NkNk electrons per unit of
volume, whose natural frequency is ωkωk and whose damping factor
is γkγk. We would then have for our dispersion equation
n=1+q2e2ϵ0m∑kNkω2k−ω2+iγkω.(31.20)(31.20)n=1+qe22ϵ0m∑kNkωk2−ω2+iγkω.
We have, finally, a complete expression which describes the index of
refraction that is observed for many substances.1
The real part of the index described by this formula varies with frequency roughly like the curve
shown in Fig. 31–5(a).
Fig. 31–5.The index of refraction as a function of frequency.
You will note that so long as ωω is not too close to one of the
resonant frequencies, the slope of the curve is positive. Such a
positive slope is called “normal” dispersion (because it is clearly the
most common occurrence). Very near the resonant frequencies, however,
there is a small range of ωω’s for which the slope is negative.
Such a negative slope is often referred to as “anomalous” (meaning
abnormal) dispersion, because it seemed
unusual when it was first observed, long before anyone even knew there
were such things as electrons. From our point of view both slopes are
quite “normal”!
31–4Absorption
Perhaps you have noticed something a little strange about the last
form (Eq. 31.20) we obtained for our dispersion
equation. Because of the term iγiγ we put in to take account of
damping, the index of refraction is now a complex number! What
does that mean?
By working out what the real and imaginary
parts of nn are we could write
n=n′−in′′,(31.21)(31.21)n=n′−in″,
where n′n′ and n′′n″ are real numbers. (We use the minus sign in front
of the in′′in″ because then n′′n″ will turn out to be a positive
number, as you can show for yourself.)
We can see what such a complex index means when there is only one resonant frequency by going back to
Eq. (31.6), which is the equation of the wave after it goes
through a plate of material with an index nn. If we put our complex nn
into this equation, and do some rearranging, we get
Eafter plate=E0e−ωn′′Δz/cAe−iω(n′−1)Δz/cE0eiω(t−z/c)B.(31.22)(31.22)Eafter plate=E0e−ωn″Δz/c⏟Ae−iω(n′−1)Δz/cE0eiω(t−z/c)⏟B.
The last factors, marked B in Eq. (31.22), are just the
form we had before, and again describe a wave whose phase has been
delayed by the angle ω(n′−1)Δz/cω(n′−1)Δz/c in traversing the
material. The first term (A) is new and is an exponential factor with
a real exponent, because there were two ii’s that
cancelled. Also, the exponent is negative, so the factor is a real
number less than one. It describes a decrease in the magnitude
of the field and, as we should expect, by an amount which is more the
larger ΔzΔz is. As the wave goes through the material, it is
weakened. The material is “absorbing” part of the wave. The wave
comes out the other side with less energy. We should not be surprised
at this, because the damping we put in for the oscillators is indeed a
friction force and must be expected to cause a loss of energy. We see
that the imaginary part n′′n″ of a complex index of refraction
represents an absorption (or “attenuation”) of
the wave. In fact, n′′n″ is sometimes referred to as the “absorption
index.”
We may also point out that an imaginary part to the index nn
corresponds to bending the arrow EaEa in Fig. 31–3
toward the origin. It is clear why the transmitted field is then
decreased.
Normally, for instance as in glass, the absorption of light is very
small. This is to be expected from our Eq. (31.20),
because the imaginary part of the denominator, iγkωiγkω, is
much smaller than the term (ω2k−ω2)(ωk2−ω2). But if the light
frequency ωω is very close to ωkωk then the resonance
term (ω2k−ω2)(ωk2−ω2) can become small compared with
iγkωiγkω and the index becomes almost completely
imaginary, as shown in Fig. 31–5(b).
The absorption of the light becomes the dominant effect. It
is just this effect that gives the dark lines in the spectrum of light
which we receive from the sun. The light from the solar surface has
passed through the sun’s atmosphere (as well as the earth’s), and the
light has been strongly absorbed at the resonant frequencies of the
atoms in the solar atmosphere.
The observation of such spectral lines in the sunlight allows us to
tell the resonant frequencies of the atoms and hence the chemical
composition of the sun’s atmosphere. The same kind of observations
tell us about the materials in the stars. From such measurements we
know that the chemical elements in the sun and in the stars are the
same as those we find on the earth.
31–5The energy carried by an electric wave
We have seen that the imaginary part of the index means absorption. We
shall now use this knowledge to find out how much energy is carried by
a light wave. We have given earlier an argument that the energy
carried by light is proportional to E2¯¯¯¯¯¯E2¯, the time average
of the square of the electric field in the wave. The decrease in EE
due to absorption must mean a loss of energy, which would go into some
friction of the electrons and, we might guess, would end up as heat in
the material.
If we consider the light arriving on a unit area, say one square
centimeter, of our plate in Fig. 31–1, then we can write
the following energy equation (if we assume that energy is conserved,
as we do!):
Energy in per sec=energy out per sec+work done per sec.(31.23)(31.23)Energy in per sec=energy out per sec+work done per sec.
For the first term we can write αE2s¯¯¯¯¯¯αEs2¯, where
αα is the as yet unknown constant of proportionality which
relates the average value of E2E2 to the energy being carried. For
the second term we must include the part from the radiating atoms of
the material, so we should use α(Es+Ea)2¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯α(Es+Ea)2¯, or
(evaluating the square) α(E2s¯¯¯¯¯¯+2EsEa¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯+E2a¯¯¯¯¯¯)α(Es2¯+2EsEa¯+Ea2¯).
All of our calculations have been made for a thin layer of material
whose index is not too far from 11, so that EaEa would always be
much less than EsEs (just to make the calculations easier). In
keeping with our approximations, we should, therefore, leave out the
term E2a¯¯¯¯¯¯Ea2¯, because it is much smaller than
EsEa¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯EsEa¯. You may say: “Then you should leave out
EsEa¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯EsEa¯ also, because it is much smaller than
E2s¯¯¯¯¯¯Es2¯.”
It is true that EsEa¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯EsEa¯ is much
smaller than E2s¯¯¯¯¯¯Es2¯, but we must keep EsEa¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯EsEa¯
or our approximation will be the one that would apply if we neglected
the presence of the material completely!
One way of checking that our
calculations are consistent is to see that we always keep terms which
are proportional to NΔzNΔz, the area density of atoms in the
material, but we leave out terms which are proportional to (NΔz)2(NΔz)2 or any higher power of NΔzNΔz. Ours is what should be
called a “low-density approximation.”
In the same spirit, we might remark that our energy equation has
neglected the energy in the reflected wave. But that is OK because
this term, too, is proportional to (NΔz)2(NΔz)2, since the
amplitude of the reflected wave is proportional to NΔzNΔz.
For the last term in Eq. (31.23) we wish to compute the
rate at which the incoming wave is doing work on the electrons. We
know that work is force times distance, so the rate of doing
work (also called power) is the force times the velocity. It is really
F⋅vF⋅v, but we do not need to worry about the dot product
when the velocity and force are along the same direction as they are
here (except for a possible minus sign). So for each atom we take
qeEsv¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯qeEsv¯ for the average rate of doing work. Since there
are NΔzNΔz atoms in a unit area, the last term in
Eq. (31.23) should be NΔzqeEsv¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯NΔzqeEsv¯. Our
energy equation now looks like
αE2s¯¯¯¯¯¯=αE2s¯¯¯¯¯¯+2αEsEa¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯+NΔzqeEsv¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯.(31.24)(31.24)αEs2¯=αEs2¯+2αEsEa¯+NΔzqeEsv¯.
The E2s¯¯¯¯¯¯Es2¯ terms cancel, and we have
2αEsEa¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯=−NΔzqeEsv¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯.(31.25)(31.25)2αEsEa¯=−NΔzqeEsv¯.
We now go back to Eq. (30.19), which tells us that for
large zz
Ea=−NΔzqe2ϵ0cv(ret by z/c)(31.26)(31.26)Ea=−NΔzqe2ϵ0cv(ret by z/c)
(recalling that η=NΔzη=NΔz). Putting Eq. (31.26)
into the left-hand side of (31.25), we get
−2αNΔzqe2ϵ0cEs(at z)⋅v(ret by z/c)¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯.−2αNΔzqe2ϵ0cEs(at z)⋅v(ret by z/c)¯.
However, Es(at z)Es(at z) is Es(at atoms)Es(at atoms) retarded
by z/cz/c. Since the average is independent of time, it is the same now as
retarded by z/cz/c, or is Es(at atoms)⋅v¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯Es(at atoms)⋅v¯, the
same average that appears on the right-hand side of (31.25).
The two sides are therefore equal if
αϵ0c=1,orα=ϵ0c.(31.27)(31.27)αϵ0c=1,orα=ϵ0c.
We have discovered that if energy is to be conserved, the energy
carried in an electric wave per unit area and per unit time (or what
we have called the intensity) must be given by ϵ0cE2¯¯¯¯¯¯ϵ0cE2¯. If we call the intensity S¯¯¯S¯, we have
S¯¯¯=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪intensityorenergy/area/time⎫⎭⎬⎪⎪=ϵ0cE2¯¯¯¯¯¯,(31.28)(31.28)S¯={intensityorenergy/area/time}=ϵ0cE2¯,
where the bar means the time average. We have a nice
bonus result from our theory of the refractive index!
31–6Diffraction of light by a screen
It is now a good time to take up a somewhat different matter which we
can handle with the machinery of this chapter. In the last chapter we
said that when you have an opaque screen and the light can come
through some holes, the distribution of intensity—the diffraction
pattern—could be obtained by imagining instead that the holes are
replaced by sources (oscillators) uniformly distributed over the
hole. In other words, the diffracted wave is the same as though the
hole were a new source. We have to explain the reason for that,
because the hole is, of course, just where there are no
sources, where there are no accelerating charges.
Let us first ask: “What is an opaque screen?” Suppose we have
a completely opaque screen between a source SS and an observer
at PP, as in Fig. 31–6(a). If the screen is “opaque”
there is no field at PP. Why is there no field there? According to
the basic principles we should obtain the field at PP as the
field EsEs of the source delayed, plus the field from all the other charges
around. But, as we have seen above, the charges in the screen will be
set in motion by the field EsEs, and these motions generate a new
field which, if the screen is opaque, must exactly cancel the
field EsEs on the back side of the screen. You say: “What a miracle
that it balances exactly!
Suppose it was not exactly right!”
If it were not exactly right (remember that this opaque screen has
some thickness), the field toward the rear part of the screen would
not be exactly zero. So, not being zero, it would set into motion some
other charges in the material of the screen, and thus make a little
more field, trying to get the total balanced out. So if we make the
screen thick enough, there is no residual field, because there is
enough opportunity to finally get the thing quieted down. In terms of
our formulas above we would say that the screen has a large and
imaginary index, so the wave is absorbed exponentially as it goes
through. You know, of course, that a thin enough sheet of the most
opaque material, even gold, is transparent.
Fig. 31–6.Diffraction by a screen.
Now let us see what happens with an opaque screen which has holes in
it, as in Fig. 31–6(b). What do we expect for the field
at PP? The field at PP can be represented as a sum of two
parts—the field due to the source SS plus the field due to the
wall, i.e., due to the motions of the charges in the walls. We might
expect the motions of the charges in the walls to be complicated, but
we can find out what fields they produce in a rather simple
way.
Suppose that we were to take the same screen, but plug up the holes,
as indicated in part (c) of the figure. We imagine that the plugs are
of exactly the same material as the wall. Mind you, the plugs go where
the holes were in case (b). Now let us calculate the field at PP. The
field at PP is certainly zero in case (c), but it is also
equal to the field from the source plus the field due to all the
motions of the atoms in the walls and in the plugs. We can write the
following equations:
Case (b):Case (c):Eat PE′at P=Es+Ewall,=0=Es+E′wall+E′plug,Case (b):Eat P=Es+Ewall,Case (c):Eat P′=0=Es+Ewall′+Eplug′,
where the primes refer to the case where the plugs are in place, but
EsEs is, of course, the same in both cases. Now if we subtract the
two equations, we get
Eat P=(Ewall−E′wall)−E′plug.Eat P=(Ewall−Ewall′)−Eplug′.
Now if the holes are not too small (say many wavelengths across), we
would not expect the presence of the plugs to change the fields which
arrive at the walls except possibly for a little bit around the edges
of the holes. Neglecting this small effect, we can set
Ewall=E′wallEwall=Ewall′ and obtain that
Eat P=−E′plug.Eat P=−Eplug′.
We have the result that the field at PP when there are holes
in a screen (case b) is the same (except for sign) as the field that
is produced by that part of a complete opaque wall which is
located where the holes are! (The sign is not too interesting,
since we are usually interested in intensity which is proportional to
the square of the field.) It seems like an amazing backwards-forwards
argument. It is, however, not only true (approximately for not too
small holes), but useful, and is the justification for the usual
theory of diffraction.
The field E′plugEplug′ is computed in any particular case by
remembering that the motion of the charges everywhere in the
screen is just that which will cancel out the field EsEs on the back
of the screen. Once we know these motions, we add the radiation fields
at PP due just to the charges in the plugs.
We remark again that this theory of diffraction is only approximate,
and will be good only if the holes are not too small. For holes which
are too small the E′plugEplug′ term will be small and then the
difference between E′wallEwall′ and EwallEwall (which
difference we have taken to be zero) may be comparable to or larger
than the small E′plugEplug′ term, and our approximation will no
longer be valid.
Actually,
although in quantum mechanics Eq. (31.20) is still valid,
its interpretation is somewhat different. In quantum mechanics even an
atom with one electron, like hydrogen, has several resonant
frequencies. Therefore NkNk is not really the number of electrons
having the frequency ωkωk, but is replaced instead by NfkNfk,
where NN is the number of atoms per unit volume and fkfk (called the
oscillator strength) is a factor that tells how strongly the atom
exhibits each of its resonant frequencies ωkωk.
