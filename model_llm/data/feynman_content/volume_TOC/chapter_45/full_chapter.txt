45–1Internal energy
Thermodynamics is a rather difficult and complex subject
when we come to apply it, and it is not appropriate for us to go very
far into the applications in this course. The subject is of very great
importance, of course, to engineers and chemists, and those who are
interested in the subject can learn about the applications in physical
chemistry or in engineering thermodynamics. There are also good equation
reference books, such as Zemansky’s Heat and Thermodynamics,
where one can learn more about the subject. In the Encyclopedia
Britannica, fourteenth edition, one can find excellent articles on
thermodynamics and thermochemistry, and in the article on chemistry, the
sections on physical chemistry, vaporization, liquefication of gases,
and so on.
The subject of thermodynamics is complicated because there are so many
different ways of describing the same thing. If we wish to describe
the behavior of a gas, we can say that the pressure depends on the
temperature and on the volume, or we can say that the volume depends
on the temperature and the pressure. Or with respect to the internal
energy UU, we might say that it depends on the temperature and
volume, if those are the variables we have chosen—but we might also
say that it depends on the temperature and the pressure, or the
pressure and the volume, and so on. In the last chapter we discussed
another function of temperature and volume, called the entropy SS,
and we can of course construct as many other functions of these
variables as we like: U−TSU−TS is a function of temperature and
volume. So we have a large number of different quantities which can be
functions of many different combinations of variables.
To keep the subject simple in this chapter, we shall decide at the
start to use temperature and volume as the independent
variables. Chemists use temperature and pressure, because they are
easier to measure and control in chemical experiments, but we shall
use temperature and volume throughout this chapter, except in one
place where we shall see how to make the transformation into the
chemists’ system of variables.
We shall first, then, consider only one system of independent
variables: temperature and volume. Secondly, we shall discuss only two
dependent functions: the internal energy and the pressure. All the
other functions can be derived from these, so it is not necessary to
discuss them. With these limitations, thermodynamics is still a fairly
difficult subject, but it is not quite so impossible!
First we shall review some mathematics. If a quantity is a function of
two variables, the idea of the derivative of the quantity requires a
little more careful thought than for the case where there is only one
variable. What do we mean by the derivative of the pressure with
respect to the temperature? The pressure change accompanying a change
in the temperature depends partly, of course, on what happens to the
volume while TT is changing. We must specify the change in VV
before the concept of a derivative with respect to TT has a precise
meaning. We might ask, for example, for the rate of change of PP with
respect to TT if VV is held constant. This ratio is just the
ordinary derivative that we usually write as dP/dTdP/dT. We customarily
use a special symbol, ∂P/∂T∂P/∂T, to remind us that PP depends on
another variable VV as well as on TT, and that this other variable
is held constant. We shall not only use the symbol ∂∂ to call
attention to the fact that the other variable is held constant, but we
shall also write the variable that is held constant as a subscript,
(∂P/∂T)V(∂P/∂T)V. Since we have only two independent variables, this
notation is redundant, but it will help us keep our wits about us in
the thermodynamic jungle of partial derivatives.
Let us suppose that the function f(x,y)f(x,y) depends on the two
independent variables xx and yy. By (∂f/∂x)y(∂f/∂x)y we mean simply
the ordinary derivative, obtained in the usual way, if we treat yy as
a constant:
(∂f∂x)y=limitΔx→0f(x+Δx,y)−f(x,y)Δx.(∂f∂x)y=limitΔx→0⁡f(x+Δx,y)−f(x,y)Δx.
Similarly, we define
(∂f∂y)x=limitΔy→0f(x,y+Δy)−f(x,y)Δy.(∂f∂y)x=limitΔy→0⁡f(x,y+Δy)−f(x,y)Δy.
For example, if f(x,y)=x2+yxf(x,y)=x2+yx, then (∂f/∂x)y=2x+y(∂f/∂x)y=2x+y,
and (∂f/∂y)x=x(∂f/∂y)x=x. We can extend this idea to higher
derivatives: ∂2f/∂y2∂2f/∂y2 or ∂2f/∂y∂x∂2f/∂y∂x. The latter symbol indicates that we first differentiate
ff with respect to xx, treating yy as a constant, then
differentiate the result with respect to yy, treating xx as a
constant. The actual order of differentiation is immaterial:
∂2f/∂x∂y=∂2f/∂y∂x∂2f/∂x∂y=∂2f/∂y∂x.
We will need to compute the change ΔfΔf in f(x,y)f(x,y) when xx
changes to x+Δxx+Δx and yy changes to y+Δyy+Δy. We
assume throughout the following that ΔxΔx and ΔyΔy are
infinitesimally small:
Δf=+f(x+Δx,y+Δy)=+f(x+Δx,y+Δy)=+f(x,y+Δy)=Δx(∂f∂x)y+Δy(∂f∂y−−−)xf(x,y)f(x,y+Δy)f(x,y)(45.1)Δf=+f(x+Δx,y+Δy)−f(x,y)=+f(x+Δx,y+Δy)−f(x,y+Δy)=+f(x,y+Δy)−f(x,y)(45.1)=Δx(∂f∂x)y+Δy(∂f∂y)x
The last equation is the fundamental relation that expresses ΔfΔf in terms of ΔxΔx and ΔyΔy.
As an example of the use of this relation, let us calculate the change
in the internal energy U(T,V)U(T,V) when the temperature changes from TT
to T+ΔTT+ΔT and the volume changes from VV to V+ΔVV+ΔV. Using Eq. (45.1), we write
ΔU=ΔT(∂U∂T)V+ΔV(∂U∂V)T.(45.2)(45.2)ΔU=ΔT(∂U∂T)V+ΔV(∂U∂V)T.
In our last chapter we found another expression for the change ΔUΔU in the internal energy when a quantity of heat ΔQΔQ was added
to the gas:
ΔU=ΔQ−PΔV.(45.3)(45.3)ΔU=ΔQ−PΔV.
In comparing Eqs. (45.2) and (45.3) one might at
first be inclined to think that P=−(∂U/∂V)TP=−(∂U/∂V)T, but this is not correct.
To obtain the correct relation, let us first suppose that we add a quantity of
heat ΔQΔQ to the gas while keeping the volume constant, so that ΔV=0ΔV=0. With ΔV=0ΔV=0, Eq. (45.3) tells us that ΔU=ΔQΔU=ΔQ, and Eq. (45.2) tells us that ΔU=(∂U/∂T)VΔTΔU=(∂U/∂T)VΔT, so that (∂U/∂T)V=ΔQ/ΔT(∂U/∂T)V=ΔQ/ΔT. The
ratio ΔQ/ΔTΔQ/ΔT, the amount of heat one must put into a substance in
order to change its temperature by one degree with the volume held constant, is
called the specific heat at constant volume and is
designated by the symbol CVCV. By this argument we have shown that
(∂U∂T)V=CV.(45.4)(45.4)(∂U∂T)V=CV.
Now let us again add a quantity of heat ΔQΔQ to the gas, but this
time we will hold TT constant and allow the volume to change by ΔVΔV. The analysis in this case is more complex, but we can calculate
ΔUΔU by the argument of Carnot, making use of the
Carnot cycle we introduced in the last chapter.
Fig. 45–1.Pressure-volume diagram for a Carnot cycle. The curves marked
TT and T−ΔTT−ΔT are isothermal lines; the steeper curves are
adiabatic lines. ΔVΔV is the volume change as heat ΔQΔQ
is added to the gas at constant temperature TT. ΔPΔP is the
pressure change at constant volume as the gas temperature is changed
from TT to T−ΔTT−ΔT.
The pressure-volume diagram for the Carnot cycle is shown in
Fig. 45–1. As we have already shown, the total amount of
work done by the gas in a reversible cycle is ΔQ(ΔT/T)ΔQ(ΔT/T),
where ΔQΔQ is the amount of heat energy added to the gas as it
expands isothermally at temperature TT from volume VV to V+ΔVV+ΔV, and T−ΔTT−ΔT is the final temperature reached by the gas as it
expands adiabatically on the second leg of the cycle. Now we will show
that this work done is also given by the shaded area in
Fig. 45–1. In any circumstances, the work done by the gas
is ∫PdV∫PdV, and is positive when the gas expands and negative when the
gas is compressed. If we plot PP vs. VV, the variation of PP
and VV is represented by a curve which gives the value of PP corresponding
to a particular value of VV. As the volume changes from one value to
another, the work done by the gas, the integral ∫PdV∫PdV, is the
area under the curve connecting the initial and final values of VV.
When we apply this idea to the Carnot cycle, we see that as we go around
the cycle, paying attention to the sign of the work done by the gas, the
net work done by the gas is just the shaded area in
Fig. 45–1.
Now we want to evaluate the shaded area geometrically. The cycle we
have used in Fig. 45–1 differs from that used in the
previous chapter in that we now suppose that ΔTΔT and ΔQΔQ
are infinitesimally small. We are working between adiabatic lines and
isothermal lines that are very close together, and the figure
described by the heavy lines in Fig. 45–1 will approach
a parallelogram as the increments ΔTΔT and ΔQΔQ approach
zero. The area of this parallelogram is just ΔVΔPΔVΔP,
where ΔVΔV is the change in volume as energy ΔQΔQ is added
to the gas at constant temperature, and ΔPΔP is the change in
pressure as the temperature changes by ΔTΔT at constant
volume. One can easily show that the shaded area in
Fig. 45–1 is given by ΔVΔPΔVΔP by recognizing
that the shaded area is equal to the area enclosed by the dotted lines
in Fig. 45–2, which in turn differs from the rectangle
bounded by ΔPΔP and ΔVΔV only by the addition and
subtraction of the equal triangular areas in Fig. 45–2.
Fig. 45–2.Shaded area==area enclosed by dashed lines==area of
rectangle=ΔPΔV=ΔPΔV.
Now let us summarize the results of the arguments we have developed so
far:

Equation (45.5) expresses the essential result of
Carnot’s argument. The whole of
thermodynamics can be deduced from Eq. (45.5) and the First
Law, which is stated in Eq. (45.3).
Equation (45.5) is essentially the Second Law, although it
was originally deduced by
Carnot
in a slightly different form, since he did not use our
definition of temperature.
Now we can proceed to calculate (∂U/∂V)T(∂U/∂V)T. By how much would
the internal energy UU change if we changed the volume by ΔVΔV?
First, UU changes because heat is put in, and second, UU changes
because work is done. The heat put in is
ΔQ=T(∂P∂T)VΔV,ΔQ=T(∂P∂T)VΔV,
according to Eq. (45.5), and the work done on the
substance is −PΔV−PΔV. Therefore the change ΔUΔU in
internal energy has two pieces:
ΔU=T(∂P∂T)VΔV−PΔV.(45.6)(45.6)ΔU=T(∂P∂T)VΔV−PΔV.
Dividing both sides by ΔVΔV, we find for the rate of change
of UU with VV at constant TT
(∂U∂V)T=T(∂P∂T)V−P.(45.7)(45.7)(∂U∂V)T=T(∂P∂T)V−P.
In our thermodynamics, in which TT and VV are the only variables and PP
and UU are the only functions, Eqs. (45.3)
and (45.7) are the basic equations from which all the results of the
subject can be deduced.
45–2Applications
Now let us discuss the meaning of Eq. (45.7) and see why it
answers the questions which we proposed in our last chapter. We
considered the following problem: in kinetic theory it is obvious that
an increase in temperature leads to an increase in pressure, because of
the bombardments of the atoms on a piston. For the same physical reason,
when we let the piston move back, heat is taken out of the gas and, in
order to keep the temperature constant, heat will have to be put back
in. The gas cools when it expands, and the pressure rises when it is
heated. There must be some connection between these two phenomena, and
this connection is given explicitly in Eq. (45.7). If we
hold the volume fixed and increase the temperature, the pressure rises
at a rate (∂P/∂T)V(∂P/∂T)V. Related to that fact is this: if we
increase the volume, the gas will cool unless we pour some heat in to
maintain the temperature constant, and (∂U/∂V)T(∂U/∂V)T tells us the
amount of heat needed to maintain the temperature.
Equation (45.7) expresses the fundamental interrelationship
between these two effects. That is what we promised we would find when
we came to the laws of thermodynamics. Without knowing the internal
mechanism of the gas, and knowing only that we cannot make perpetual
motion of the second type, we can deduce the relationship between the
amount of heat needed to maintain a constant temperature when the gas
expands, and the pressure change when the gas is heated at constant
volume!
Now that we have the result we wanted for a gas, let us consider the
rubber band. When we stretch a rubber band, we find that its
temperature rises, and when we heat a rubber band, we find that it
pulls itself in. What is the equation that gives the same relation for
a rubber band as Eq. (45.3) gives for gas? For a rubber
band the situation will be something like this: when heat ΔQΔQ
is put in, the internal energy is changed by ΔUΔU and some work
is done. The only difference will be that the work done by the rubber
band is −FΔL−FΔL instead of PΔVPΔV, where FF is the
force on the band, and LL is the length of the band. The force FF is
a function of temperature and of length of the band. Replacing
PΔVPΔV in Eq. (45.3) by −FΔL−FΔL, we get
ΔU=ΔQ+FΔL.(45.8)(45.8)ΔU=ΔQ+FΔL.
Comparing Eqs. (45.3) and (45.8), we see that the
rubber band equation is obtained by a mere substitution of one letter for
another. Furthermore, if we substitute LL for VV, and −F−F for PP, all of our
discussion of the Carnot cycle applies to the rubber band. We can
immediately deduce, for instance, that the heat ΔQΔQ needed to change the
length by ΔLΔL is given by the analog to Eq. (45.5): ΔQ=−T(∂F/∂T)LΔLΔQ=−T(∂F/∂T)LΔL. This equation tells us that if we keep the
length of a rubber band fixed and heat the band, we can calculate how much the
force will increase in terms of the heat needed to keep the temperature constant
when the band is relaxed a little bit. So we see that the same equation applies
to both gas and a rubber band. In fact, if one can write ΔU=ΔQ+AΔBΔU=ΔQ+AΔB, where AA and BB represent different quantities, force and
length, pressure and volume, etc., one can apply the results obtained for a gas
by substituting AA and BB for −P−P and VV. For example, consider the electric
potential difference, or “voltage,” EE in a battery and the charge ΔZΔZ
that moves through the battery. We know that the work done in a reversible
electric cell, like a storage battery, is EΔZEΔZ. (Since we include no
PΔVPΔV term in the work, we require that our battery maintain a constant
volume.) Let us see what thermodynamics can tell us about the performance of a
battery. If we substitute EE for PP and ZZ for VV in Eq. (45.6),
we obtain
ΔUΔZ=T(∂E∂T)Z−E.(45.9)(45.9)ΔUΔZ=T(∂E∂T)Z−E.
Equation (45.9) says that the internal energy UU is
changed when a charge ΔZΔZ moves through the cell. Why
is ΔU/ΔZΔU/ΔZ not simply the voltage EE of the battery? (The
answer is that a real battery gets warm when charge moves through the
cell. The internal energy of the battery is changed, first, because
the battery did some work on the outside circuit, and second, because
the battery is heated.) The remarkable thing is that the second part
can again be expressed in terms of the way in which the battery
voltage changes with temperature. Incidentally, when the charge moves
through the cell, chemical reactions occur, and Eq. (45.9)
suggests a nifty way of measuring the amount of energy required to
produce a chemical reaction. All we need to do is construct a cell that
works on the reaction, measure the voltage, and measure how much the
voltage changes with temperature when we draw no charge from the
battery!
Now we have assumed that the volume of the battery can be maintained
constant, since we have omitted the PΔVPΔV term when we set the
work done by the battery equal to EΔZEΔZ. It turns out that it
is technically quite difficult to keep the volume constant. It is much
easier to keep the cell at constant atmospheric pressure. For that
reason, the chemists do not like any of the equations we have written
above: they prefer equations which describe performance under constant
pressure. We chose at the beginning of this chapter to use VV
and TT as independent variables. The chemists prefer PP and TT, and
we will now consider how the results we have obtained so far can be
transformed into the chemists’ system of variables. Remember that in
the following treatment confusion can easily set in because we are
shifting gears from TT and VV to TT and PP.
We started in Eq. (45.3) with ΔU=ΔQ−PΔVΔU=ΔQ−PΔV; PΔVPΔV may be replaced by EΔZEΔZ
or AΔBAΔB. If we could somehow replace the last term, PΔVPΔV, by VΔPVΔP, then we would have interchanged VV and PP, and
the chemists would be happy. Well, a clever man noticed that the
differential of the product PVPV is d(PV)=PdV+VdPd(PV)=PdV+VdP, and if he
added this equality to Eq. (45.3), he obtained
Δ(PV)ΔUΔ(U+PV)=PΔV=ΔQ=ΔQ+VΔP−PΔV+VΔPΔ(PV)=PΔV+VΔPΔU=ΔQ−PΔVΔ(U+PV)=ΔQ+VΔP
In order that the result look like Eq. (45.3), we define
U+PVU+PV to be something new, called the
enthalpy, HH, and we write ΔH=ΔQ+VΔPΔH=ΔQ+VΔP.
Now we are ready to transform our results into chemists’ language with
the following rules: U→HU→H, P→−VP→−V, V→PV→P. For example, the
fundamental relationship that chemists would use instead of
Eq. (45.7) is
(∂H∂P)T=−T(∂V∂T)P+V.(∂H∂P)T=−T(∂V∂T)P+V.
It should now be clear how one transforms to the chemists’ variables
TT and PP. We now go back to our original variables: for the
remainder of this chapter, TT and VV are the independent variables.
Now let us apply the results we have obtained to a number of physical
situations. Consider first the ideal gas. From kinetic theory we know
that the internal energy of a gas depends only on the motion of the
molecules and the number of molecules. The internal energy depends
on TT, but not on VV. If we change VV, but keep TT constant, UU is
not changed. Therefore (∂U/∂V)T=0(∂U/∂V)T=0, and Eq. (45.7)
tells us that for an ideal gas
T(∂P∂T)V−P=0.(45.10)(45.10)T(∂P∂T)V−P=0.
Equation (45.10) is a differential equation that can tell
us something about PP. We take account of the partial derivatives in
the following way: Since the partial derivative is at constant VV, we
will replace the partial derivative by an ordinary derivative and
write explicitly, to remind us, “constant VV.”
Equation (45.10) then becomes
TΔPΔT−P=0;const V,(45.11)(45.11)TΔPΔT−P=0;const V,
which we can integrate to get
lnPP=lnT+const;=const×T;const V,const V.(45.12)ln⁡P=ln⁡T+const;const V,(45.12)P=const×T;const V.
We know that for an ideal gas the pressure per mole is equal to
P=RTV,(45.13)(45.13)P=RTV,
which is consistent with (45.12), since VV and RR are
constants. Why did we bother to go through this calculation if we
already knew the results? Because we have been using two
independent definitions of temperature! At one stage we assumed that
the kinetic energy of the molecules was proportional to the
temperature, an assumption that defines one scale of temperature which
we will call the ideal gas scale. The TT in Eq. (45.13)
is based on the gas scale. We also call temperatures measured on the
gas scale kinetic temperatures. Later, we defined the
temperature in a second way which was completely independent of any
substance. From arguments based on the Second Law we defined what we
might call the “grand thermodynamic absolute temperature” TT,
the TT that appears in Eq. (45.12). What we proved here is
that the pressure of an ideal gas (defined as one for which the
internal energy does not depend on the volume) is proportional to the
grand thermodynamic absolute temperature. We also know that the
pressure is proportional to the temperature measured on the gas
scale. Therefore we can deduce that the kinetic temperature is
proportional to the “grand thermodynamic absolute temperature.” That
means, of course, that if we were sensible we could make two scales
agree. In this instance, at least, the two scales have been
chosen so that they coincide; the proportionality constant has been
chosen to be 11. Most of the time man chooses trouble for himself,
but in this case he made them equal!
45–3The Clausius-Clapeyron equation
The vaporization of a liquid is another application of the results we
have derived. Suppose we have some liquid in a cylinder, such that we
can compress it by pushing on the piston, and we ask ourselves, “If
we keep the temperature constant, how does the pressure vary with
volume?” In other words, we want to draw an isothermal line on the
PP-VV diagram. The substance in the cylinder is not the ideal gas
that we considered earlier; now it may be in the liquid or the vapor
phase, or both may be present. If we apply sufficient pressure, the
substance will condense to a liquid. Now if we squeeze still harder,
the volume changes very little, and our isothermal line rises rapidly
with decreasing volume, as shown at the left in Fig. 45–3.
Fig. 45–3.Isothermal lines for a condensable vapor
compressed in a cylinder. At the left, the substance is in the liquid phase.
At the right, the substance is vaporized. In the center, both liquid and
vapor are present in the cylinder.
If we increase the volume by pulling the piston out, the pressure
drops until we reach the point at which the liquid starts to boil, and
then vapor starts to form. If we pull the piston out farther, all that
happens is that more liquid vaporizes. When there is part liquid and
part vapor in the cylinder, the two phases are in equilibrium—liquid
is evaporating and vapor is condensing at the same rate. If we make
more room for the vapor, more vapor is needed to maintain the
pressure, so a little more liquid evaporates, but the pressure remains
constant. On the flat part of the curve in Fig. 45–3 the
pressure does not change, and the value of the pressure here is called
the vapor pressure at temperature TT. As we continue to
increase the volume, there comes a time when there is no more liquid
to evaporate. At this juncture, if we expand the volume further, the
pressure will fall as for an ordinary gas, as shown at the right of
the PP-VV diagram. The lower curve in Fig. 45–3 is the
isothermal line at a slightly lower temperature T−ΔTT−ΔT. The
pressure in the liquid phase is slightly reduced because liquid
expands with an increase in temperature (for most substances, but not
for water near the freezing point) and, of course, the vapor pressure
is lower at the lower temperature.
Fig. 45–4.Pressure-volume diagram for a Carnot cycle with a condensable
vapor in the cylinder. At the left, the substance is in the liquid
state. A quantity of heat LL is added at temperature TT to
vaporize the liquid. The vapor expands adiabatically as TT changes
to T−ΔTT−ΔT.
We will now make a cycle out of the two isothermal lines by connecting
them (say by adiabatic lines) at both ends of the upper flat section, as
shown in Fig. 45–4. We are going to use the argument of
Carnot, which tells us that the
heat added to the substance in changing it from a liquid to a vapor is
related to the work done by the substance as it goes around the cycle.
Let us call LL the heat needed to vaporize the substance in the
cylinder. As in the argument immediately preceding
Eq. (45.5), we know that L(ΔT/T)=L(ΔT/T)=work done by the
substance. As before, the work done by the substance is the shaded area,
which is approximately ΔP(VG−VL)ΔP(VG−VL), where ΔPΔP is the
difference in vapor pressure at the two temperatures TT and T−ΔTT−ΔT, VGVG is the volume of the gas, and VLVL is the volume of the
liquid, both volumes measured at the vapor pressure at temperature TT.
Setting these two expressions for the area equal, we get LΔT/T=ΔP(VG−VL)LΔT/T=ΔP(VG−VL), or
LT(VG−VL)=(∂Pvap/∂T).(45.14)(45.14)LT(VG−VL)=(∂Pvap/∂T).
Equation (45.14) gives the relationship between the rate of
change of vapor pressure with temperature and the amount of heat
required to evaporate the liquid. This relationship was deduced by
Carnot, but it is called the
Clausius-Clapeyron equation.
Now let us compare Eq. (45.14) with the results deduced
from kinetic theory. Usually VGVG is very much larger than VLVL. So
VG−VL≈VG=RT/PVG−VL≈VG=RT/P per mole. If we further assume that LL
is a constant, independent of temperature—not a very good
approximation—then we would have ∂P/∂T=L/(RT2/P)∂P/∂T=L/(RT2/P). The
solution of this differential equation is
P=conste−L/RT.(45.15)(45.15)P=conste−L/RT.
Let us compare this with the pressure variation with temperature that
we deduced earlier from kinetic theory. Kinetic theory indicated the
possibility, at least roughly, that the number of molecules per unit volume of vapor
above a liquid would be
n=(1Va)e−(UG−UL)/RT,(45.16)(45.16)n=(1Va)e−(UG−UL)/RT,
where UG−ULUG−UL is the internal energy per mole in the gas minus the
internal energy per mole in the liquid, i.e., the energy needed to
vaporize a mole of liquid. Equation (45.15) from
thermodynamics and Eq. (45.16) from kinetic theory are very
closely related because the pressure is nkTnkT, but they are not exactly
the same. However, they will turn out to be exactly the same if we
assume UG−UL=constUG−UL=const, instead of L=constL=const. If we
assume UG−UL=constUG−UL=const, independent of temperature, then the
argument leading to Eq. (45.15) will produce
Eq. (45.16). Since the pressure is constant while the volume
is changing, the change in internal energy UG−ULUG−UL is equal to the
heat LL put in minus the work done P(VG−VL)P(VG−VL),
so L=(UG+PVG)−(UL+PVL)L=(UG+PVG)−(UL+PVL).
This comparison shows the advantages and disadvantages of thermodynamics over
kinetic theory: First of all, Eq. (45.14) obtained by thermodynamics
is exact, while Eq. (45.16) can only be approximated, for instance,
if UU is nearly constant, and if the model is right. Second, we may not
understand correctly how the gas goes into the liquid; nevertheless,
Eq. (45.14) is right, while (45.16) is only approximate.
Third, although our treatment applies to a gas condensing into a liquid, the
argument is true for any other change of state. For instance, the
solid-to-liquid transition has the same kind of curve as that shown in
Figs. 45–3 and 45–4. Introducing the latent heat
for melting, MM/mole, the formula analogous to Eq. (45.14) then
is (∂Pmelt/∂T)V=M/[T(Vliq−Vsolid)](∂Pmelt/∂T)V=M/[T(Vliq−Vsolid)].
Although we may not understand the kinetic theory of the melting process, we
nevertheless have a correct equation. However, when we can understand the
kinetic theory, we have another advantage. Equation (45.14) is only a
differential relationship, and we have no way of obtaining the constants of
integration. In the kinetic theory we can obtain the constants also if we have a
good model that describes the phenomenon completely. So there are advantages and
disadvantages to each. When knowledge is weak and the situation is complicated,
thermodynamic relations are really the most powerful. When the situation is very
simple and a theoretical analysis can be made, then it is better to try to get
more information from theoretical analysis.
One more example: blackbody radiation. We have discussed a box
containing radiation and nothing else. We have talked about the
equilibrium between the oscillator and the radiation. We also found
that the photons hitting the wall of the box would exert the
pressure PP, and we found PV=U/3PV=U/3, where UU is the total energy of all the
photons and VV is the volume of the box. If we substitute U=3PVU=3PV
in the basic Eq. (45.7), we find1
(∂U∂V)T=3P=T(∂P∂T)V−P.(45.17)(45.17)(∂U∂V)T=3P=T(∂P∂T)V−P.
Since the volume of our box is constant, we can replace
(∂P/∂T)V(∂P/∂T)V by dP/dTdP/dT to obtain an ordinary differential equation
we can integrate: lnP=4lnT+constln⁡P=4ln⁡T+const, or P=const×T4P=const×T4. The pressure of radiation varies as the fourth
power of the temperature, and the total energy density of the radiation,
U/V=3PU/V=3P, also varies as T4T4. It is usual to write U/V=(4σ/c)T4U/V=(4σ/c)T4, where cc is the speed of light and σσ is called
the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
It is not possible to get σσ from thermodynamics alone. Here is a
good example of its power, and its limitations. To know that U/VU/V goes
as T4T4 is a great deal, but to know how big U/VU/V actually is at any
temperature requires that we go into the kind of detail that only a
complete theory can supply. For blackbody radiation we have such a
theory and we can derive an expression for the constant σσ in the
following manner.
Let I(ω)dωI(ω)dω be the intensity distribution, the energy
flow through 11 m² in one second with frequency between ωω
and ω+dωω+dω. The energy density
distribution==energy/volume=I(ω)dω/c=I(ω)dω/c is
UV=total energy density=∫∞ω=0energy density between ω and ω+dω=∫∞0I(ω)dωc.UV=total energy density=∫ω=0∞energy density between ω and ω+dω=∫0∞I(ω)dωc.
From our earlier discussions, we know that
I(ω)=ℏω3π2c2(eℏω/kT−1).I(ω)=ℏω3π2c2(eℏω/kT−1).
Substituting this expression for I(ω)I(ω) in our equation for U/VU/V, we get
UV=1π2c3∫∞0ℏω3dωeℏω/kT−1.UV=1π2c3∫0∞ℏω3dωeℏω/kT−1.
If we substitute x=ℏω/kTx=ℏω/kT, the expression becomes
UV=(kT)4ℏ3π2c3∫∞0x3dxex−1.UV=(kT)4ℏ3π2c3∫0∞x3dxex−1.
This integral is just some number that we can get, approximately, by
drawing a curve and taking the area by counting squares. It is
roughly 6.56.5. The mathematicians among us can show that the integral is
exactly π4/15π4/15.2
Comparing this expression with U/V=(4σ/c)T4U/V=(4σ/c)T4, we find
σ=k4π260ℏ3c2=5.67×10−8watts(meter)2(degree)4.σ=k4π260ℏ3c2=5.67×10−8watts(meter)2(degree)4.
If we make a small hole in our box, how much energy will flow per
second through the hole of unit area? To go from energy density to
energy flow, we multiply the energy density U/VU/V by cc. We also
multiply by 1414, which arises as follows: first, a factor
of 1212, because only the energy which is flowing out
escapes; and second, another factor 1212, because energy
which approaches the hole at an angle to the normal is less effective
in getting through the hole by a cosine factor. The average value of
the cosine factor is 1212. It is clear now why we write U/V=(4σ/c)T4U/V=(4σ/c)T4: so that we can ultimately say that the flux from a
small hole is σT4σT4 per unit area.
In this case
(∂P/∂V)T=0(∂P/∂V)T=0, because in order to keep the oscillator in
equilibrium at a given temperature, the radiation in the neighborhood of
the oscillator has to be the same, regardless of the volume of the box.
The total quantity of photons inside the box must therefore be
proportional to its volume, so the internal energy per unit volume, and
thus the pressure, depends only on the temperature.

Since (ex−1)−1=e−x+e−2x+⋯(ex−1)−1=e−x+e−2x+⋯, the integral is
∑n=1∞∫∞0e−nxx3dx.∑n=1∞∫0∞e−nxx3dx.
But ∫∞0e−nxdx=1/n∫0∞e−nxdx=1/n, and differentiating with
respect to nn three times gives ∫∞0x3e−nxdx=6/n4∫0∞x3e−nxdx=6/n4, so the integral is 6(1+116+181+⋯)6(1+116+181+⋯) and a good estimate comes from adding the first few terms. In
Chapter 50 we will find a way to show that the sum of the
reciprocal fourth powers of the integers is, in fact, π4/90π4/90.
