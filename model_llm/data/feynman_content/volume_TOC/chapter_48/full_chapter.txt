48–1Adding two waves
Some time ago we discussed in considerable detail the properties of
light waves and their
interference—that is, the effects of the superposition of two waves
from different sources. In all these analyses we assumed that the
frequencies of the sources were all the same. In this chapter we shall
discuss some of the phenomena which result from the interference of two
sources which have different frequencies.
It is easy to guess what is going to happen. Proceeding in the same
way as we have done previously, suppose we have two equal oscillating
sources of the same frequency whose phases are so adjusted, say, that
the signals arrive in phase at some point PP. At that point, if it is
light, the light is very strong; if it is sound, it is very loud; or
if it is electrons, many of them arrive. On the other hand, if the
arriving signals were 180∘180∘ out of phase, we would get no signal
at PP, because the net amplitude there is then a minimum. Now suppose
that someone twists the “phase knob” of one of the sources and
changes the phase at PP back and forth, say, first making it
0∘0∘ and then 180∘180∘, and so on. Of course, we would then
find variations in the net signal strength. Now we also see that if
the phase of one source is slowly changing relative to that of the
other in a gradual, uniform manner, starting at zero, going up to ten,
twenty, thirty, forty degrees, and so on, then what we would measure
at PP would be a series of strong and weak “pulsations,” because
when the phase shifts through 360∘360∘ the amplitude returns to a
maximum. Of course, to say that one source is shifting its phase
relative to another at a uniform rate is the same as saying that the
number of oscillations per second is slightly different for the two.
So we know the answer: if we have two sources at slightly different
frequencies we should find, as a net result, an oscillation with a
slowly pulsating intensity. That is all there really is to the
subject!
Fig. 48–1.The superposition of two cosine waves with frequencies in the
ratio 8:108:10. The precise repetition of the pattern within each
“beat” is not typical of the general case.
It is very easy to formulate this result mathematically also. Suppose,
for example, that we have two waves, and that we do not worry for the
moment about all the spatial relations, but simply analyze what
arrives at PP. From one source, let us say, we would have
cosω1tcos⁡ω1t, and from the other source, cosω2tcos⁡ω2t, where the
two ωω’s are not exactly the same. Of course the amplitudes may
not be the same, either, but we can solve the general problem later;
let us first take the case where the amplitudes are equal. Then the
total amplitude at PP is the sum of these two cosines. If we plot the
amplitudes of the waves against the time, as in Fig. 48–1,
we see that where the crests coincide we get a strong wave, and where a
trough and crest coincide we get practically zero, and then when the
crests coincide again we get a strong wave again.
Mathematically, we need only to add two cosines and rearrange the
result somehow. There exist a number of useful relations among cosines
which are not difficult to derive. Of course we know that
ei(a+b)=eiaeib,(48.1)(48.1)ei(a+b)=eiaeib,
and that eiaeia has a real part, cosacos⁡a, and an imaginary part,
sinasin⁡a. If we take the real part of ei(a+b)ei(a+b), we get cos(a+b)cos(a+b). If we multiply out:
eiaeib=(cosa+isina)(cosb+isinb),eiaeib=(cos⁡a+isin⁡a)(cos⁡b+isin⁡b),
we get cosacosb−sinasinbcos⁡acos⁡b−sin⁡asin⁡b, plus some imaginary parts. But
we now need only the real part, so we have
cos(a+b)=cosacosb−sinasinb.(48.2)(48.2)cos(a+b)=cos⁡acos⁡b−sin⁡asin⁡b.
Now if we change the sign of bb, since the cosine does not change
sign while the sine does, the same equation, for negative bb, is
cos(a−b)=cosacosb+sinasinb.(48.3)(48.3)cos(a−b)=cos⁡acos⁡b+sin⁡asin⁡b.
If we add these two equations together, we lose the sines and we learn
that the product of two cosines is half the cosine of the sum, plus
half the cosine of the difference:
cosacosb=12cos(a+b)+12cos(a−b).(48.4)(48.4)cos⁡acos⁡b=12cos(a+b)+12cos(a−b).
Now we can also reverse the formula and find a formula for cosα+cosβcos⁡α+cos⁡β if we simply let α=a+bα=a+b and β=a−bβ=a−b. That is, a=12(α+β)a=12(α+β) and b=12(α−β)b=12(α−β), so that
cosα+cosβ=2cos12(α+β)cos12(α−β).(48.5)(48.5)cos⁡α+cos⁡β=2cos⁡12(α+β)cos⁡12(α−β).
Now we can analyze our problem. The sum of cosω1tcos⁡ω1t
and cosω2tcos⁡ω2t is
cosω1t+cosω2t= 2cos12(ω1+ω2)tcos12(ω1−ω2)t.(48.6)cos⁡ω1t+cos⁡ω2t=(48.6) 2cos⁡12(ω1+ω2)tcos⁡12(ω1−ω2)t.
Now let us suppose that the two frequencies are nearly the same, so
that 12(ω1+ω2)12(ω1+ω2) is the average frequency, and
is more or less the same as either. But ω1−ω2ω1−ω2 is
much smaller than ω1ω1 or ω2ω2 because, as we
suppose, ω1ω1 and ω2ω2 are nearly equal. That means that
we can represent the solution by saying that there is a high-frequency
cosine wave more or less like the ones we started with, but that its
“size” is slowly changing—its “size” is pulsating with a
frequency which appears to be 12(ω1−ω2)12(ω1−ω2). But
is this the frequency at which the beats are heard?
Although (48.6) says that the amplitude goes
as cos12(ω1−ω2)tcos⁡12(ω1−ω2)t, what it is really telling us
is that the high-frequency oscillations are contained between two
opposed cosine curves (shown dotted in Fig. 48–1). On this
basis one could say that the amplitude varies at the
frequency 12(ω1−ω2)12(ω1−ω2), but if we are talking about the
intensity of the wave we must think of it as having twice this
frequency. That is, the modulation of the amplitude, in the sense of the
strength of its intensity, is at frequency ω1−ω2ω1−ω2,
although the formula tells us that we multiply by a cosine wave at half
that frequency. The technical basis for the difference is that the high
frequency-wave has a little different phase relationship in the second
half-cycle.
Ignoring this small complication, we may conclude that if we add two
waves of frequency ω1ω1 and ω2ω2, we will get a net
resulting wave of average frequency 12(ω1+ω2)12(ω1+ω2) which oscillates in strength with a frequency ω1−ω2ω1−ω2.
If the two amplitudes are different, we can do it all over again by
multiplying the cosines by different amplitudes A1A1 and A2A2, and
do a lot of mathematics, rearranging, and so on, using equations
like (48.2)–(48.5). However, there are other,
easier ways of doing the same analysis. For example, we know that it is
much easier to work with exponentials than with sines and cosines and
that we can represent A1cosω1tA1cos⁡ω1t as the real part
of A1eiω1tA1eiω1t. The other wave would similarly be the real part
of A2eiω2tA2eiω2t. If we add the two, we get A1eiω1t+A2eiω2tA1eiω1t+A2eiω2t. If we then factor out the average frequency, we have
A1eiω1t+A2eiω2t=ei(ω1+ω2)t/2[A1ei(ω1−ω2)t/2+A2e−i(ω1−ω2)t/2].(48.7)A1eiω1t+A2eiω2t=(48.7)ei(ω1+ω2)t/2[A1ei(ω1−ω2)t/2+A2e−i(ω1−ω2)t/2].
Again we have the high-frequency wave with a modulation at the lower
frequency.
48–2Beat notes and modulation
If we are now asked for the intensity of the wave of
Eq. (48.7), we can either take the absolute square of the
left side, or of the right side. Let us take the left side. The
intensity then is
I=A21+A22+2A1A2cos(ω1−ω2)t.(48.8)(48.8)I=A12+A22+2A1A2cos(ω1−ω2)t.
We see that the intensity swells and falls at a frequency ω1−ω2ω1−ω2, varying between the limits (A1+A2)2(A1+A2)2 and (A1−A2)2(A1−A2)2. If A1≠A2A1≠A2, the minimum intensity is not zero.
Fig. 48–2.The resultant of two complex vectors of equal frequency.
One more way to represent this idea is by means of a drawing, like
Fig. 48–2. We draw a vector of length A1A1, rotating at
a frequency ω1ω1, to represent one of the waves in the complex
plane. We draw another vector of length A2A2, going around at a
frequency ω2ω2, to represent the second wave. If the two
frequencies are exactly equal, their resultant is of fixed length as
it keeps revolving, and we get a definite, fixed intensity from the
two. But if the frequencies are slightly different, the two complex
vectors go around at different speeds. Figure 48–3 shows
what the situation looks like relative to the
vector A1eiω1tA1eiω1t. We see that A2A2 is turning slowly away
from A1A1, and so the amplitude that we get by adding the two is first
strong, and then, as it opens out, when it gets to the
180∘180∘ relative position the resultant gets particularly weak, and so on. As
the vectors go around, the amplitude of the sum vector gets bigger and
smaller, and the intensity thus pulsates. It is a relatively simple
idea, and there are many different ways of representing the same
thing.
Fig. 48–3.The resultant of two complex vectors of unequal frequency, as
seen in the rotating frame of reference of one vector. Nine
successive positions of the slowly rotating vector are shown.
The effect is very easy to observe experimentally. In the case of
acoustics, we may arrange two loudspeakers driven by two separate
oscillators, one for each loudspeaker, so that they each make a
tone. We thus receive one note from one source and a different note
from the other source. If we make the frequencies exactly the same,
the resulting effect will have a definite strength at a given space
location. If we then de-tune them a little bit, we hear some
variations in the intensity. The farther they are de-tuned, the more
rapid are the variations of sound. The ear has some trouble following
variations more rapid than ten or so per second.
We may also see the effect on an oscilloscope which simply displays
the sum of the currents to the two speakers. If the frequency of
pulsing is relatively low, we simply see a sinusoidal wave train whose
amplitude pulsates, but as we make the pulsations more rapid we see
the kind of wave shown in Fig. 48–1. As we go to greater
frequency differences, the “bumps” move closer together. Also, if
the amplitudes are not equal and we make one signal stronger than the
other, then we get a wave whose amplitude does not ever become zero,
just as we expect. Everything works the way it should, both
acoustically and electrically.
The opposite phenomenon occurs too! In radio transmission using
so-called amplitude modulation (am), the sound is
broadcast by the radio station as follows: the radio transmitter has
an ac electric oscillation which is at a very high frequency,
for example 800800 kilocycles per second, in the broadcast band. If
this carrier signal is turned on, the radio
station emits a wave which is of uniform amplitude at
800,000800,000 oscillations a second. The way the “information” is
transmitted, the useless kind of information about what kind of car to
buy, is that when somebody talks into a microphone the amplitude of the
carrier signal is changed in step with the vibrations of sound entering
the microphone.
Fig. 48–4.A modulated carrier wave. In this schematic sketch,
ωc/ωm=5ωc/ωm=5. In an actual radiowave,
ωc/ωm∼100ωc/ωm∼100.
If we take as the simplest mathematical case the situation where a
soprano is singing a perfect note, with perfect sinusoidal
oscillations of her vocal cords, then we get a signal whose strength
is alternating as shown in Fig. 48–4. The audiofrequency
alternation is then recovered in the receiver; we get rid of the
carrier wave and just look at the envelope which represents the
oscillations of the vocal cords, or the sound of the singer. The
loudspeaker then makes corresponding vibrations at the same frequency
in the air, and the listener is then essentially unable to tell the
difference, so they say. Because of a number of distortions and other
subtle effects, it is, in fact, possible to tell whether we are
listening to a radio or to a real soprano; otherwise the idea is as
indicated above.
48–3Side bands
Mathematically, the modulated wave described above would be expressed
as
S=(1+bcosωmt)cosωct,(48.9)(48.9)S=(1+bcos⁡ωmt)cos⁡ωct,
where ωcωc represents the frequency of the carrier and
ωmωm is the frequency of the audio tone. Again we use all those
theorems about the cosines, or we can use eiθeiθ; it makes no
difference—it is easier with eiθeiθ, but it is the same
thing. We then get
S=cosωct+12bcos(ωc+ωm)t+12bcos(ωc−ωm)t.(48.10)S=cos⁡ωct+12bcos(ωc+ωm)t(48.10)+12bcos(ωc−ωm)t.
So, from another point of view, we can say that the output wave of the
system consists of three waves added in superposition: first, the
regular wave at the frequency ωcωc, that is, at the carrier
frequency, and then two new waves at two new frequencies. One is the
carrier frequency plus the modulation frequency, and the other is the
carrier frequency minus the modulation frequency. If, therefore, we
make some kind of plot of the intensity being generated by the
generator as a function of frequency, we would find a lot of intensity
at the frequency of the carrier, naturally, but when a singer started
to sing, we would suddenly also find intensity proportional to the
strength of the singer, b2b2, at frequency ωc+ωmωc+ωm and
ωc−ωmωc−ωm, as shown in Fig. 48–5. These are
called side bands; when there is a modulated signal from the
transmitter, there are side bands. If there is more than one note at
the same time, say ωmωm and ωm′ωm′, there are two
instruments playing; or if there is any other complicated cosine wave,
then, of course, we can see from the mathematics that we get some more
waves that correspond to the frequencies ωc±ωm′ωc±ωm′.
Fig. 48–5.The frequency spectrum of a carrier wave ωcωc modulated
by a single cosine wave ωmωm.
Therefore, when there is a complicated modulation that can be
represented as the sum of many cosines,1 we find that the actual transmitter is transmitting
over a range of frequencies, namely the carrier frequency plus or
minus the maximum frequency that the modulation signal contains.
Although at first we might believe that a radio transmitter transmits
only at the nominal frequency of the carrier, since there are big,
superstable crystal oscillators in there, and everything is adjusted
to be at precisely 800800 kilocycles, the moment someone
announces that they are at 800800 kilocycles, he modulates the
800800 kilocycles, and so they are no longer precisely at
800800 kilocycles!
Suppose that the amplifiers are so built that they are
able to transmit over a good range of the ear’s sensitivity (the ear
can hear up to 20,00020,000 cycles per second, but usually radio
transmitters and receivers do not work beyond 10,00010,000, so we do not
hear the highest parts), then, when the man speaks, his voice may
contain frequencies ranging up, say, to 10,00010,000 cycles, so the
transmitter is transmitting frequencies which may range from 790790
to 810810 kilocycles per second. Now if there were another station at
795795 kc/sec, there would be a lot of confusion. Also, if we made our
receiver so sensitive that it picked up only 800800, and did not pick
up the 1010 kilocycles on either side, we would not hear what the man
was saying, because the information would be on these other
frequencies!
Therefore it is absolutely essential to keep the
stations a certain distance apart, so that their side bands do not
overlap and, also, the receiver must not be so selective that it does
not permit reception of the side bands as well as of the main nominal
frequency. In the case of sound, this problem does not really cause
much trouble. We can hear over a ±20±20 kc/sec range, and we have
usually from 500500 to 15001500 kc/sec in the broadcast band, so there is
plenty of room for lots of stations.
The television problem is more difficult. As the electron beam goes
across the face of the picture tube, there are various little spots of
light and dark. That “light” and “dark” is the “signal.” Now
ordinarily the beam scans over the whole picture, 500500 lines,
approximately, in a thirtieth of a second. Let us consider that the
resolution of the picture vertically and horizontally is more or less
the same, so that there are the same number of spots per inch along a
scan line. We want to be able to distinguish dark from light, dark
from light, dark from light, over, say, 500500 lines. In order to be
able to do this with cosine waves, the shortest wavelength needed thus
corresponds to a wavelength, from maximum to maximum, of one
250250th of the screen size. So we have 250×500×30250×500×30 pieces of
information per second. The highest frequency that we are going to
carry, therefore, is close to 44 megacycles per second. Actually, to
keep the television stations apart, we have to use a little bit more
than this, about 66 mc/sec; part of it is used to carry the sound
signal, and other information. So, television channels are
66 megacycles per second wide. It certainly would not be possible to
transmit tv on an 800800 kc/sec carrier, since we cannot
modulate at a higher frequency than the carrier.
At any rate, the television band starts at 5454 megacycles. The first
transmission channel, which is channel 22 (!), has a frequency range
from 5454 to 6060 mc/sec, which is 66 mc/sec wide. “But,” one might
say, “we have just proved that there were side bands on both sides,
and therefore it should be twice that wide.” It turns out that the
radio engineers are rather clever. If we analyze the modulation signal
using not just cosine terms, but cosine and sine terms, to allow for
phase differences, we then see that there is a definite, invariant
relationship between the side band on the high-frequency side and the
side band on the low-frequency side. What we mean is that there is no
new information on that other side band. So what is done is to
suppress one side band, and the receiver is wired inside such that the
information which is missing is reconstituted by looking at the single
side band and the carrier. Single side-band transmission is a clever
scheme for decreasing the band widths needed to transmit information.
48–4Localized wave trains
The next subject we shall discuss is the interference of waves in both
space and time. Suppose that we have two waves travelling in space. We
know, of course, that we can represent a wave travelling in space by
ei(ωt−kx)ei(ωt−kx). This might be, for example, the displacement
in a sound wave. This is a solution of the wave equation provided that
ω2=k2c2ω2=k2c2, where cc is the speed of propagation of the
wave. In this case we can write it as e−ik(x−ct)e−ik(x−ct), which is of
the general form f(x−ct)f(x−ct). Therefore this must be a wave which is
travelling at this velocity, ω/kω/k, and that is cc and
everything is all right.
Now we want to add two such waves together. Suppose we have a wave
that is travelling with one frequency, and another wave travelling
with another frequency. We leave to the reader to consider the case
where the amplitudes are different; it makes no real difference. Thus
we want to add ei(ω1t−k1x)+ei(ω2t−k2x)ei(ω1t−k1x)+ei(ω2t−k2x).
We can add these by the same kind of mathematics we used when we added
signal waves. Of course, if cc is the same for both, this is easy,
since it is the same as what we did before:
eiω1(t−x/c)+eiω2(t−x/c)=eiω1t′+eiω2t′,(48.11)(48.11)eiω1(t−x/c)+eiω2(t−x/c)=eiω1t′+eiω2t′,
except that t′=t−x/ct′=t−x/c is the variable instead of tt. So we get
the same kind of modulations, naturally, but we see, of course, that
those modulations are moving along with the wave. In other words, if
we added two waves, but these waves were not just oscillating, but
also moving in space, then the resultant wave would move along also,
at the same speed.
Now we would like to generalize this to the case of waves in which the
relationship between the frequency and the wave number kk is not so
simple. Example: material having an index of refraction. We have
already studied the theory of the index of refraction in
Chapter 31, where we found that we could write k=nω/ck=nω/c, where nn is the index of refraction. As an interesting
example, for x-rays we found that
the index nn is
n=1−Nq2e2ϵ0mω2.(48.12)(48.12)n=1−Nqe22ϵ0mω2.
We actually derived a more complicated formula in
Chapter 31, but this one is as good as any, as an example.
Incidentally, we know that even when ωω and kk are not linearly
proportional, the ratio ω/kω/k is certainly the speed of
propagation for the particular frequency and wave number. We call this
ratio the phase velocity; it is the speed at which the
phase, or the nodes of a single wave, would move along:
vp=ωk.(48.13)(48.13)vp=ωk.
This phase velocity, for the case of
x-rays in glass, is greater than
the speed of light in vacuum (since nn in 48.12 is less
than 11), and that is a bit bothersome, because we do not think we can
send signals faster than the speed of light!
What we are going to discuss now is the interference of two waves in
which ωω and kk have a definite formula relating them. The
above formula for nn says that kk is given as a definite function
of ωω. To be specific, in this particular problem, the formula
for kk in terms of ωω is
k=ωc−aωc,(48.14)(48.14)k=ωc−aωc,
where a=Nq2e/2ϵ0ma=Nqe2/2ϵ0m, a constant. At any rate, for each
frequency there is a definite wave number, and we want to add two such
waves together.
Let us do it just as we did in Eq. (48.7):
ei(ω1t−k1x)+ei[(ω1+ω2)t−(k1+k2)x]/2×[ei(ω2t−k2x)=ei[(ω1−ω2)t−(k1−k2)x]/2+e−i[(ω1−ω2)t−(k1−k2)x]/2].(48.15)(48.15)ei(ω1t−k1x)+ei(ω2t−k2x)=ei[(ω1+ω2)t−(k1+k2)x]/2×[ei[(ω1−ω2)t−(k1−k2)x]/2+e−i[(ω1−ω2)t−(k1−k2)x]/2].
So we have a modulated wave again, a wave which travels with the mean
frequency and the mean wave number, but whose strength is varying with
a form which depends on the difference frequency and the difference
wave number.
Now let us take the case that the difference between the two waves is
relatively small. Let us suppose that we are adding two waves whose
frequencies are nearly equal; then (ω1+ω2)/2(ω1+ω2)/2 is
practically the same as either one of the ωω’s, and similarly
for (k1+k2)/2(k1+k2)/2. Thus the speed of the wave, the fast
oscillations, the nodes, is still essentially ω/kω/k. But look,
the speed of propagation of the modulation is not the same! How much
do we have to change xx to account for a certain amount of tt? The
speed of this modulation wave is the ratio
vM=ω1−ω2k1−k2.(48.16)(48.16)vM=ω1−ω2k1−k2.
The speed of modulation is sometimes called the group
velocity. If we take
the case that the difference in frequency is relatively small, and the
difference in wave number is then also relatively small, then this
expression approaches, in the limit,
vg=dωdk.(48.17)(48.17)vg=dωdk.
In other words, for the slowest modulation, the slowest beats, there
is a definite speed at which they travel which is not the same as the
phase speed of the waves—what a mysterious thing!
The group velocity is
the derivative of ωω with respect to kk, and the phase velocity is ω/kω/k.
Let us see if we can understand why. Consider two waves, again of
slightly different wavelength, as in Fig. 48–1. They are
out of phase, in phase, out of phase, and so on. Now these waves
represent, really, the waves in space travelling with slightly
different frequencies also. Now because the phase velocity, the
velocity of the nodes of these two waves, is not precisely the same,
something new happens. Suppose we ride along with one of the waves and
look at the other one; if they both went at the same speed, then the
other wave would stay right where it was relative to us, as we ride
along on this crest. We ride on that crest and right opposite us we
see a crest; if the two velocities are equal the crests stay on top of
each other. But it is not so that the two velocities are really
equal. There is only a small difference in frequency and therefore
only a small difference in velocity, but because of that difference in
velocity, as we ride along the other wave moves slowly forward, say,
or behind, relative to our wave. So as time goes on, what happens to
the node? If we move one wave train just a shade forward, the node
moves forward (or backward) a considerable distance. That is, the sum
of these two waves has an envelope, and as the waves travel along, the
envelope rides on them at a different speed. The group
velocity is the
speed at which modulated signals would be transmitted.
If we made a signal, i.e., some kind of change in the wave that one
could recognize when he listened to it, a kind of modulation, then
that modulation would travel at the group velocity, provided that the
modulations were relatively slow. (When they are fast, it is much more
difficult to analyze.)
Now we may show (at long last), that the speed of propagation of
x-rays in a block of carbon is
not greater than the speed of light, although the phase velocity
is greater than the speed of light. In order to do that, we must
find dω/dkdω/dk, which we get by differentiating (48.14):
dk/dω=1/c+a/ω2cdk/dω=1/c+a/ω2c. The group velocity, therefore, is the
reciprocal of this, namely,
vg=c1+a/ω2,(48.18)(48.18)vg=c1+a/ω2,
which is smaller than cc! So although the phases can travel faster
than the speed of light, the modulation signals travel slower, and
that is the resolution of the apparent paradox! Of course, if we have
the simple case that ω=kcω=kc, then dω/dkdω/dk is also cc. So
when all the phases have the same velocity, naturally the group has
the same velocity.
48–5Probability amplitudes for particles
Let us now consider one more example of the phase velocity which is
extremely interesting. It has to do with quantum mechanics. We know
that the amplitude to find a particle at a place can, in some
circumstances, vary in space and time, let us say in one dimension, in
this manner:
ψ=Aei(ωt−kx),(48.19)(48.19)ψ=Aei(ωt−kx),
where ωω is the frequency, which is related to the classical
idea of the energy through E=ℏωE=ℏω, and kk is the wave
number, which is related to the momentum through p=ℏkp=ℏk. We
would say the particle had a definite momentum pp if the wave number
were exactly kk, that is, a perfect wave which goes on with the same
amplitude everywhere. Equation (48.19) gives the amplitude,
and if we take the absolute square, we get the relative probability
for finding the particle as a function of position and time. This is a
constant, which means that the probability is the same to find
a particle anywhere. Now suppose, instead, that we have a situation
where we know that the particle is more likely to be at one place than
at another. We would represent such a situation by a wave which has a
maximum and dies out on either side (Fig. 48–6). (It is
not quite the same as a wave like Fig. 48–1, which has a series
of maxima, but it is possible, by adding several waves of nearly the
same ωω and kk together, to get rid of all but one maximum.)
Fig. 48–6.A localized wave train.
Now in those circumstances, since the square of (48.19)
represents the chance of finding a particle somewhere, we know that at
a given instant the particle is most likely to be near the center of
the “lump,” where the amplitude of the wave is maximum. If now we
wait a few moments, the waves will move, and after some time the
“lump” will be somewhere else. If we knew that the particle
originally was situated somewhere, classically, we would expect
that it would later be elsewhere as a matter of fact, because it has a
speed, after all, and a momentum. The quantum theory, then,
will go into the correct classical theory for the relationship of
momentum, energy, and velocity only if the group velocity, the
velocity of the modulation, is equal to the velocity that we would
obtain classically for a particle of the same momentum.
It is now necessary to demonstrate that this is, or is not, the
case. According to the classical theory, the energy is related to the
velocity through an equation like
E=mc21−v2/c2−−−−−−−−√.(48.20)(48.20)E=mc21−v2/c2.
Similarly, the momentum is
p=mv1−v2/c2−−−−−−−−√.(48.21)(48.21)p=mv1−v2/c2.
That is the classical theory, and as a consequence of the classical
theory, by eliminating vv, we can show that
E2−p2c2=m2c4.E2−p2c2=m2c4.
That is the four-dimensional grand result that we have talked and
talked about, that pμpμ=m2pμpμ=m2; that is the relation between
energy and momentum in the classical theory. Now that means, since
these EE’s and pp’s are going to become ωω’s and kk’s, by
substitution of E=ℏωE=ℏω and p=ℏkp=ℏk, that for quantum
mechanics it is necessary that
ℏ2ω2c2−ℏ2k2=m2c2.(48.22)(48.22)ℏ2ω2c2−ℏ2k2=m2c2.
This, then, is the relationship between the frequency and the wave
number of a quantum-mechanical amplitude wave representing a particle
of mass mm. From this equation we can deduce that ωω is
ω=ck2+m2c2/ℏ2−−−−−−−−−−−√.ω=ck2+m2c2/ℏ2.
The phase velocity, ω/kω/k, is here again faster than the speed of
light!
Now let us look at the group velocity. The group velocity should
be dω/dkdω/dk, the speed at which the modulations move. We have to
differentiate a square root, which is not very difficult. The
derivative is
dωdk=kck2+m2c2/ℏ2−−−−−−−−−−−√.dωdk=kck2+m2c2/ℏ2.
Now the square root is, after all, ω/cω/c, so we could write this
as dω/dk=c2k/ωdω/dk=c2k/ω. Further, k/ωk/ω is p/Ep/E, so
vg=c2pE.vg=c2pE.
But from (48.20) and (48.21), c2p/E=vc2p/E=v, the
velocity of the particle, according to classical mechanics. So we see
that whereas the fundamental quantum-mechanical relationship E=ℏωE=ℏω and p=ℏkp=ℏk, for the identification of ωω
and kk with the classical EE and pp, only produces the
equation ω2−k2c2=m2c4/ℏ2ω2−k2c2=m2c4/ℏ2, now we also understand the
relationships (48.20) and (48.21) which
connected EE and pp to the velocity. Of course the group velocity
must be the velocity of the particle if the interpretation is going to
make any sense. If we think the particle is over here at one time, and
then ten minutes later we think it is over there, as the quantum
mechanics said, the distance traversed by the “lump,” divided by the
time interval, must be, classically, the velocity of the particle.
48–6Waves in three dimensions
We shall now bring our discussion of waves to a close with a few
general remarks about the wave equation. These remarks are intended to
give some view of the future—not that we can understand everything
exactly just now, but rather to see what things are going to look like
when we study waves a little more. First of all, the wave equation for
sound in one dimension was
∂2χ∂x2=1c2∂2χ∂t2,∂2χ∂x2=1c2∂2χ∂t2,
where cc is the speed of whatever the wave is—in the case of sound,
it is the sound speed; in the case of light, it is the speed of
light. We showed that for a sound wave the displacements would
propagate themselves at a certain speed. But the excess pressure also
propagates at a certain speed, and so does the excess density. So we
should expect that the pressure would satisfy the same equation, as
indeed it does. We shall leave it to the reader to prove that it
does. Hint: ρeρe is proportional to the rate of change
of χχ with respect to xx. Therefore if we differentiate the wave
equation with respect to xx, we will immediately discover that
∂χ/∂x∂χ/∂x satisfies the same equation. That is to say, ρeρe
satisfies the same equation. But PePe is proportional to ρeρe,
and therefore PePe does too. So the pressure, the displacements,
everything, satisfy the same wave equation.
Usually one sees the wave equation for sound written in terms of
pressure instead of in terms of displacement, because the pressure is
a scalar and has no direction. But the displacement is a vector and
has direction, and it is thus easier to analyze the pressure.
The next matter we discuss has to do with the wave equation in three
dimensions. We know that the sound wave solution in one dimension is
ei(ωt−kx)ei(ωt−kx), with ω=kcsω=kcs, but we also know that in
three dimensions a wave would be represented by ei(ωt−kxx−kyy−kzz)ei(ωt−kxx−kyy−kzz), where, in this case, ω2=k2c2sω2=k2cs2, which is,
of course, (k2x+k2y+k2z)c2s(kx2+ky2+kz2)cs2. Now what we want to do is
to guess what the correct wave equation in three dimensions
is. Naturally, for the case of sound this can be deduced by going
through the same dynamic argument in three dimensions that we made in
one dimension. But we shall not do that; instead we just write down
what comes out: the equation for the pressure (or displacement, or
anything) is
∂2Pe∂x2+∂2Pe∂y2+∂2Pe∂z2=1c2s∂2Pe∂t2.(48.23)(48.23)∂2Pe∂x2+∂2Pe∂y2+∂2Pe∂z2=1cs2∂2Pe∂t2.
That this is true can be verified by substituting in ei(ωt−k⋅r)ei(ωt−k⋅r). Clearly, every time we differentiate with respect
to xx, we multiply by −ikx−ikx. If we differentiate twice, it is
equivalent to multiplying by −k2x−kx2, so the first term would
become −k2xPe−kx2Pe, for that wave. Similarly, the second term
becomes −k2yPe−ky2Pe, and the third term becomes −k2zPe−kz2Pe. On the right, we
get −(ω2/c2s)Pe−(ω2/cs2)Pe. Then, if we take away the PePe’s and
change the sign, we see that the relationship between kk and ωω
is the one that we want.
Working backwards again, we cannot resist writing down the grand
equation which corresponds to the dispersion equation (48.22)
for quantum-mechanical waves. If ϕϕ represents the amplitude for
finding a particle at position x,y,zx,y,z, at the time tt, then the great
equation of quantum mechanics for free particles is this:
∂2ϕ∂x2+∂2ϕ∂y2+∂2ϕ∂z2−1c2∂2ϕ∂t2=m2c2ℏ2ϕ.(48.24)(48.24)∂2ϕ∂x2+∂2ϕ∂y2+∂2ϕ∂z2−1c2∂2ϕ∂t2=m2c2ℏ2ϕ.
First of all, the relativity character of this expression is suggested
by the appearance of xx, yy, zz and tt in the nice combination
relativity usually involves. Second, it is a wave equation which, if
we try a plane wave, would produce as a consequence that −k2+ω2/c2=m2c2/ℏ2−k2+ω2/c2=m2c2/ℏ2, which is the right relationship for
quantum mechanics. There is still another great thing contained in the
wave equation: the fact that any superposition of waves is also a
solution. So this equation contains all of the quantum mechanics and
the relativity that we have been discussing so far, at least so long
as it deals with a single particle in empty space with no external
potentials or forces on it!
48–7Normal modes
Now we turn to another example of the phenomenon of beats which is
rather curious and a little different. Imagine two equal pendulums
which have, between them, a rather weak spring connection. They are
made as nearly as possible the same length. If we pull one aside and
let go, it moves back and forth, and it pulls on the connecting spring
as it moves back and forth, and so it really is a machine for
generating a force which has the natural frequency of the other
pendulum. Therefore, as a consequence of the theory of resonance,
which we studied before, when we put a force on something at just the
right frequency, it will drive it. So, sure enough, one pendulum
moving back and forth drives the other. However, in this circumstance
there is a new thing happening, because the total energy of the system
is finite, so when one pendulum pours its energy into the other to
drive it, it finds itself gradually losing energy, until, if the
timing is just right along with the speed, it loses all its energy and
is reduced to a stationary condition! Then, of course, it is the other
pendulum ball that has all the energy and the first one which has
none, and as time goes on we see that it works also in the opposite
direction, and that the energy is passed back into the first ball;
this is a very interesting and amusing phenomenon. We said, however,
that this is related to the theory of beats, and we must now explain
how we can analyze this motion from the point of view of the theory of
beats.
We note that the motion of either of the two balls is an oscillation
which has an amplitude which changes cyclically. Therefore the motion
of one of the balls is presumably analyzable in a different way, in
that it is the sum of two oscillations, present at the same time but
having two slightly different frequencies. Therefore it ought to be
possible to find two other motions in this system, and to claim that
what we saw was a superposition of the two solutions, because this is
of course a linear system. Indeed, it is easy to find two ways that we
could start the motion, each one of which is a perfect,
single-frequency motion—absolutely periodic. The motion that we
started with before was not strictly periodic, since it did not last;
soon one ball was passing energy to the other and so changing its
amplitude; but there are ways of starting the motion so that nothing
changes and, of course, as soon as we see it we understand why. For
example, if we made both pendulums go together, then, since they are
of the same length and the spring is not then doing anything, they
will of course continue to swing like that for all time, assuming no
friction and that everything is perfect. On the other hand, there is
another possible motion which also has a definite frequency: that is,
if we move the pendulums oppositely, pulling them aside exactly equal
distances, then again they would be in absolutely periodic motion. We
can appreciate that the spring just adds a little to the restoring
force that the gravity supplies, that is all, and the system just
keeps oscillating at a slightly higher frequency than in the first
case. Why higher? Because the spring is pulling, in addition to the
gravitation, and it makes the system a little “stiffer,” so that the
frequency of this motion is just a shade higher than that of the
other.
Thus this system has two ways in which it can oscillate with
unchanging amplitude: it can either oscillate in a manner in which
both pendulums go the same way and oscillate all the time at one
frequency, or they could go in opposite directions at a slightly
higher frequency.
Now the actual motion of the thing, because the system is linear, can
be represented as a superposition of the two. (The subject of this
chapter, remember, is the effects of adding two motions with different
frequencies.) So think what would happen if we combined these two
solutions. If at t=0t=0 the two motions are started with equal
amplitude and in the same phase, the sum of the two motions means that
one ball, having been impressed one way by the first motion and the
other way by the second motion, is at zero, while the other ball,
having been displaced the same way in both motions, has a large
amplitude. As time goes on, however, the two basic motions
proceed independently, so the phase of one relative to the other is
slowly shifting. That means, then, that after a sufficiently long
time, when the time is enough that one motion could have gone
“9001290012” oscillations, while the other went
only “900900,” the relative phase would be just reversed with respect to
what it was before. That is, the large-amplitude motion will have
fallen to zero, and in the meantime, of course, the initially
motionless ball will have attained full strength!
So we see that we could analyze this complicated motion either by the
idea that there is a resonance and that one passes energy to the
other, or else by the superposition of two constant-amplitude motions
at two different frequencies.
A slight side remark:
In what circumstances can a curve be represented as a sum of a lot of
cosines? Answer: In all ordinary circumstances, except for
certain cases the mathematicians can dream up. Of course, the curve
must have only one value at a given point, and it must not be a crazy
curve which jumps an infinite number of times in an infinitesimal
distance, or something like that. But aside from such restrictions any
reasonable curve (one that a singer is going to be able to make by
shaking her vocal cords) can always be compounded by adding cosine
waves together.
