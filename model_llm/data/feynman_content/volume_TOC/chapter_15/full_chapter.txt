15The Special Theory of Relativity
15–1The principle of relativity
For over 200 years the equations of motion enunciated by
Newton were believed to describe
nature correctly, and the first time that an error in these laws was
discovered, the way to correct it was also discovered. Both the error
and its correction were discovered by Einstein in 1905.
Newton’s Second Law, which we have expressed by the equation
F=d(mv)/dt,F=d(mv)/dt,
was stated with the tacit assumption that mm is a constant, but we now
know that this is not true, and that the mass of a body
increases with velocity. In Einstein’s corrected formula mm has the value
m=m01−v2/c2−−−−−−−−√,(15.1)(15.1)m=m01−v2/c2,
where the “rest mass” m0m0 represents the mass of a body that is not
moving and cc is the speed of light, which is about
3×1053×105 km⋅sec−1km⋅sec−1 or about
186,000186,000 mi⋅sec−1.mi⋅sec−1.
For those who want to learn just enough about it so they can solve
problems, that is all there is to the theory of relativity—it just
changes Newton’s laws by introducing
a correction factor to the mass. From the formula itself it is easy to
see that this mass increase is very small in ordinary circumstances. If
the velocity is even as great as that of a satellite, which goes around
the earth at 55 mi/sec, then v/c=5/186,000v/c=5/186,000: putting this value
into the formula shows that the correction to the mass is only one part
in two to three billion, which is nearly impossible to observe.
Actually, the correctness of the formula has been amply confirmed by the
observation of many kinds of particles, moving at speeds ranging up to
practically the speed of light. However, because the effect is
ordinarily so small, it seems remarkable that it was discovered
theoretically before it was discovered experimentally. Empirically, at a
sufficiently high velocity, the effect is very large, but it was not
discovered that way. Therefore it is interesting to see how a law that
involved so delicate a modification (at the time when it was first
discovered) was brought to light by a combination of experiments and
physical reasoning. Contributions to the discovery were made by a number
of people, the final result of whose work was
Einstein’s discovery.
There are really two Einstein
theories of relativity. This chapter is concerned with the Special
Theory of Relativity, which dates from 1905. In 1915
Einstein published an
additional theory, called the General Theory of Relativity. This latter
theory deals with the extension of the Special Theory to the case of the
law of gravitation; we shall not discuss the General Theory here.
The principle of relativity was first stated by Newton, in one of his corollaries to the laws of motion:
“The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among
themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in
a straight line.” This means, for example, that if a space ship is
drifting along at a uniform speed, all experiments performed in the
space ship and all the phenomena in the space ship will appear the same
as if the ship were not moving, provided, of course, that one does not
look outside. That is the meaning of the principle of relativity. This
is a simple enough idea, and the only question is whether it is
true that in all experiments performed inside a moving system the
laws of physics will appear the same as they would if the system were
standing still. Let us first investigate whether Newton’s
laws appear the same in the moving system.
Fig. 15–1.Two coordinate systems in uniform relative motion along their
xx-axes.
Suppose that Moe is moving in the xx-direction with a uniform
velocity uu, and he measures the position of a certain point, shown
in Fig. 15–1. He designates the “xx-distance” of the
point in his coordinate system as x′x′. Joe is at rest, and measures the
position of the same point, designating its xx-coordinate in his system
as xx. The relationship of the coordinates in the two systems is clear
from the diagram. After time tt Moe’s origin has moved a distance utut,
and if the two systems originally coincided,
x′y′z′t′=x−ut,=y,=z,=t.(15.2)(15.2)x′=x−ut,y′=y,z′=z,t′=t.
If we substitute this transformation of coordinates into Newton’s
laws we find that these laws transform to
the same laws in the primed system; that is, the laws of Newton are of
the same form in a moving system as in a stationary system, and
therefore it is impossible to tell, by making mechanical experiments,
whether the system is moving or not.
The principle of relativity has been used in mechanics for a long time.
It was employed by various people, in particular
Huygens, to obtain the rules
for the collision of billiard balls, in much the same way as we used it
in Chapter 10 to discuss the conservation of momentum. In
the 19th century interest in it was heightened as the result of
investigations into the phenomena of electricity, magnetism, and light.
A long series of careful studies of these phenomena by many people
culminated in Maxwell’s equations of the electromagnetic field,
which describe electricity, magnetism, and light in one uniform system.
However, the Maxwell equations did not
seem to obey the principle of relativity. That is, if we transform
Maxwell’s equations by the substitution of
equations (15.2), their form does not remain the same;
therefore, in a moving space ship the electrical and optical phenomena
should be different from those in a stationary ship. Thus one could use
these optical phenomena to determine the speed of the ship; in
particular, one could determine the absolute speed of the ship by making
suitable optical or electrical measurements. One of the consequences of
Maxwell’s equations is that if there is a disturbance in the
field such that light is generated, these electromagnetic waves go out
in all directions equally and at the same speed cc, or
186,000186,000 mi/sec. Another consequence of the equations is that if the
source of the disturbance is moving, the light emitted goes through
space at the same speed cc. This is analogous to the case of sound, the
speed of sound waves being likewise independent of the motion of the
source.
This independence of the motion of the source, in the case of light,
brings up an interesting problem:
Suppose we are riding in a car that is going at a speed uu, and light
from the rear is going past the car with speed cc. Differentiating the
first equation in (15.2) gives
dx′/dt=dx/dt−u,dx′/dt=dx/dt−u,
which means that according to the Galilean
transformation the apparent speed
of the passing light, as we measure it in the car, should not be cc but
should be c−uc−u. For instance, if the car is going 100,000100,000 mi/sec,
and the light is going 186,000186,000 mi/sec, then apparently the light
going past the car should go 86,00086,000 mi/sec. In any case, by
measuring the speed of the light going past the car (if the
Galilean transformation is
correct for light), one could determine the speed of the car. A number
of experiments based on this general idea were performed to determine
the velocity of the earth, but they all failed—they gave no
velocity at all. We shall discuss one of these experiments in detail,
to show exactly what was done and what was the matter; something
was the matter, of course, something was wrong with the equations
of physics. What could it be?
15–2The Lorentz transformation
When the failure of the equations of physics in the above case came to
light, the first thought that occurred was that the trouble must lie in
the new Maxwell equations of electrodynamics,
which were only 20 years old at the time. It seemed almost obvious that
these equations must be wrong, so the thing to do was to change them in
such a way that under the Galilean
transformation the principle of
relativity would be satisfied. When this was tried, the new terms that
had to be put into the equations led to predictions of new electrical
phenomena that did not exist at all when tested experimentally, so this
attempt had to be abandoned. Then it gradually became apparent that
Maxwell’s laws of electrodynamics were correct, and the trouble must be
sought elsewhere.
In the meantime, H. A. Lorentz noticed a remarkable and curious thing when he made the
following substitutions in the Maxwell equations:
x′y′z′t′=x−ut1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√,=y,=z,=t−ux/c21−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√,(15.3)(15.3)x′=x−ut1−u2/c2,y′=y,z′=z,t′=t−ux/c21−u2/c2,
namely, Maxwell’s equations remain in the same form when this
transformation is applied to them! Equations (15.3) are known
as a Lorentz transformation. Einstein, following a suggestion originally made by
Poincaré, then proposed that
all the physical laws should be of such a kind that they
remain unchanged under a Lorentz transformation. In other words,
we should change, not the laws of electrodynamics, but the laws of
mechanics. How shall we change Newton’s laws so that they will remain unchanged by the Lorentz
transformation? If this goal is set, we then have to rewrite Newton’s
equations in such a way that the conditions we have imposed are
satisfied. As it turned out, the only requirement is that the mass mm
in Newton’s equations must be replaced by the form shown in
Eq. (15.1). When this change is made, Newton’s
laws and the laws of electrodynamics will
harmonize. Then if we use the Lorentz transformation in comparing Moe’s
measurements with Joe’s, we shall never be able to detect whether either
is moving, because the form of all the equations will be the same in
both coordinate systems!
It is interesting to discuss what it means that we replace the old
transformation between the coordinates and time with a new one, because
the old one (Galilean) seems to be self-evident, and the new one
(Lorentz) looks peculiar. We wish to know whether it is logically and
experimentally possible that the new, and not the old, transformation
can be correct. To find that out, it is not enough to study the laws of
mechanics but, as Einstein did,
we too must analyze our ideas of space and time in order
to understand this transformation. We shall have to discuss these ideas
and their implications for mechanics at some length, so we say in
advance that the effort will be justified, since the results agree with
experiment.
15–3The Michelson-Morley experiment
As mentioned above, attempts were made to determine the absolute
velocity of the earth through the hypothetical “ether” that was
supposed to pervade all space. The most famous of these experiments is
one performed by Michelson
and Morley in 1887. It was 18
years later before the negative results of the experiment were finally
explained, by Einstein.
Fig. 15–2.Schematic diagram of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
The Michelson-Morley experiment was performed with an apparatus like
that shown schematically in Fig. 15–2. This apparatus is
essentially comprised of a light source AA, a partially silvered glass
plate BB, and two mirrors CC and EE, all mounted on a rigid base. The
mirrors are placed at equal distances LL from BB. The plate BB splits
an oncoming beam of light, and the two resulting beams continue in
mutually perpendicular directions to the mirrors, where they are
reflected back to BB. On arriving back at BB, the two beams are
recombined as two superposed beams, DD and FF. If the time taken for
the light to go from BB to EE and back is the same as the time from
BB to CC and back, the emerging beams DD and FF will be in phase and
will reinforce each other, but if the two times differ slightly, the
beams will be slightly out of phase and interference will result. If the
apparatus is “at rest” in the ether, the times should be precisely
equal, but if it is moving toward the right with a velocity uu, there
should be a difference in the times. Let us see why.
First, let us calculate the time required for the light to go from BB
to EE and back. Let us say that the time for light to go from plate BB
to mirror EE is t1t1, and the time for the return is t2t2. Now, while
the light is on its way from BB to the mirror, the apparatus moves a
distance ut1ut1, so the light must traverse a distance L+ut1L+ut1, at the
speed cc. We can also express this distance as ct1ct1, so we have
ct1=L+ut1,ort1=L/(c−u).ct1=L+ut1,ort1=L/(c−u).
(This result is also obvious from the point of view that the velocity of
light relative to the apparatus is c−uc−u, so the time is the
length LL divided by c−uc−u.) In a like manner, the time t2t2 can be
calculated. During this time the plate BB advances a distance ut2ut2,
so the return distance of the light is L−ut2L−ut2. Then we have
ct2=L−ut2,ort2=L/(c+u).ct2=L−ut2,ort2=L/(c+u).
Then the total time is
t1+t2=2Lc/(c2−u2).t1+t2=2Lc/(c2−u2).
For convenience in later comparison of times we write this as
t1+t2=2L/c1−u2/c2.(15.4)(15.4)t1+t2=2L/c1−u2/c2.
Our second calculation will be of the time t3t3 for the light to go
from BB to the mirror CC. As before, during time t3t3 the mirror CC
moves to the right a distance ut3ut3 to the position C′C′; in the same
time, the light travels a distance ct3ct3 along the hypotenuse of a
triangle, which is BC′BC′. For this right triangle we have
(ct3)2=L2+(ut3)2(ct3)2=L2+(ut3)2
or
L2=c2t23−u2t23=(c2−u2)t23,L2=c2t32−u2t32=(c2−u2)t32,
from which we get
t3=L/c2−u2−−−−−−√.t3=L/c2−u2.
For the return trip from C′C′ the distance is the same, as can be seen
from the symmetry of the figure; therefore the return time is also the
same, and the total time is 2t32t3. With a little rearrangement of the
form we can write
2t3=2Lc2−u2−−−−−−√=2L/c1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√.(15.5)(15.5)2t3=2Lc2−u2=2L/c1−u2/c2.
We are now able to compare the times taken by the two beams of light. In
expressions (15.4) and (15.5) the numerators are
identical, and represent the time that would be taken if the apparatus
were at rest. In the denominators, the term u2/c2u2/c2 will be small,
unless uu is comparable in size to cc. The denominators represent the
modifications in the times caused by the motion of the apparatus. And
behold, these modifications are not the same—the time to go
to CC and back is a little less than the time to EE and back, even
though the mirrors are equidistant from BB, and all we have to do is to
measure that difference with precision.
Here a minor technical point arises—suppose the two lengths LL are
not exactly equal? In fact, we surely cannot make them exactly equal. In
that case we simply turn the apparatus 9090 degrees, so that BCBC is in
the line of motion and BEBE is perpendicular to the
motion. Any small difference in length then becomes unimportant, and
what we look for is a shift in the interference fringes when we
rotate the apparatus.
In carrying out the experiment, Michelson and Morley
oriented the apparatus so that the line BEBE was nearly parallel to the
earth’s motion in its orbit (at certain times of the day and night).
This orbital speed is about 1818 miles per second, and any “ether
drift” should be at least that much at some time of the day or night
and at some time during the year. The apparatus was amply sensitive to
observe such an effect, but no time difference was found—the velocity
of the earth through the ether could not be detected. The result of the
experiment was null.
The result of the Michelson-Morley experiment was very puzzling and most
disturbing. The first fruitful idea for finding a way out of the impasse
came from Lorentz. He
suggested that material bodies contract when they are moving, and that
this foreshortening is only in the direction of the motion, and also,
that if the length is L0L0 when a body is at rest, then when it moves
with speed uu parallel to its length, the new length, which we
call L∥L∥ (LL-parallel), is given by
L∥=L01−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√.(15.6)(15.6)L∥=L01−u2/c2.
When this modification is applied to the Michelson-Morley
interferometer apparatus the distance from BB
to CC does not change, but the distance from BB to EE is shortened
to L1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√L1−u2/c2. Therefore Eq. (15.5) is not
changed, but the LL of Eq. (15.4) must be changed in
accordance with Eq. (15.6). When this is done we obtain
t1+t2=(2L/c)1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√1−u2/c2=2L/c1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√.(15.7)(15.7)t1+t2=(2L/c)1−u2/c21−u2/c2=2L/c1−u2/c2.
Comparing this result with Eq. (15.5), we see that t1+t2=2t3t1+t2=2t3. So if the apparatus shrinks in the manner just described, we
have a way of understanding why the Michelson-Morley experiment gives no
effect at all. Although the contraction hypothesis successfully
accounted for the negative result of the experiment, it was open to the
objection that it was invented for the express purpose of explaining
away the difficulty, and was too artificial. However, in many other
experiments to discover an ether wind, similar difficulties arose, until
it appeared that nature was in a “conspiracy” to thwart man by
introducing some new phenomenon to undo every phenomenon that he thought
would permit a measurement of uu.
It was ultimately recognized, as Poincaré pointed out, that a complete conspiracy is itself a
law of nature! Poincaré then
proposed that there is such a law of nature, that it is not
possible to discover an ether wind by any experiment; that is,
there is no way to determine an absolute velocity.
15–4Transformation of time
In checking out whether the contraction idea is in harmony with the
facts in other experiments, it turns out that everything is correct
provided that the times are also modified, in the manner
expressed in the fourth equation of the set (15.3). That is
because the time 2t32t3, calculated for the trip from BB to CC and
back, is not the same when calculated by a man performing the experiment
in a moving space ship as when calculated by a stationary observer who
is watching the space ship. To the man in the ship the time is
simply 2L/c2L/c, but to the other observer it is (2L/c)/1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√(2L/c)/1−u2/c2 (Eq. 15.5). In other words, when the outsider sees
the man in the space ship lighting a cigar, all the actions appear to be
slower than normal, while to the man inside, everything moves at a
normal rate. So not only must the lengths shorten, but also the
time-measuring instruments (“clocks”) must apparently slow down. That
is, when the clock in the space ship records 11 second elapsed, as seen
by the man in the ship, it shows 1/1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√1/1−u2/c2 second to the
man outside.
This slowing of the clocks in a moving system is a very peculiar
phenomenon, and is worth an explanation. In order to understand this, we
have to watch the machinery of the clock and see what happens when it is
moving. Since that is rather difficult, we shall take a very simple kind
of clock. The one we choose is rather a silly kind of clock, but it will
work in principle: it is a rod (meter stick) with a mirror at each end,
and when we start a light signal between the mirrors, the light keeps
going up and down, making a click every time it comes down, like a
standard ticking clock. We build two such clocks, with exactly the same
lengths, and synchronize them by starting them together; then they agree
always thereafter, because they are the same in length, and light always
travels with speed cc. We give one of these clocks to the man to take
along in his space ship, and he mounts the rod perpendicular to the
direction of motion of the ship; then the length of the rod will not
change. How do we know that perpendicular lengths do not change? The men
can agree to make marks on each other’s yy-meter stick as they pass
each other. By symmetry, the two marks must come at the same yy-
and y′y′-coordinates, since otherwise, when they get together to compare
results, one mark will be above or below the other, and so we could tell
who was really moving.
Fig. 15–3.(a) A “light clock” at rest in the S′S′ system. (b) The same
clock, moving through the SS system. (c) Illustration of the diagonal
path taken by the light beam in a moving “light clock.”
Now let us see what happens to the moving clock. Before the man took it
aboard, he agreed that it was a nice, standard clock, and when he goes
along in the space ship he will not see anything peculiar. If he did, he
would know he was moving—if anything at all changed because of the
motion, he could tell he was moving. But the principle of relativity
says this is impossible in a uniformly moving system, so nothing has
changed. On the other hand, when the external observer looks at the
clock going by, he sees that the light, in going from mirror to mirror,
is “really” taking a zigzag path, since the rod is moving sidewise all
the while. We have already analyzed such a zigzag motion in connection
with the Michelson-Morley experiment.
If in a given time the rod moves forward a distance proportional to uu
in Fig. 15–3, the distance the light travels in the same
time is proportional to cc, and the vertical distance is therefore
proportional to c2−u2−−−−−−√c2−u2.
That is, it takes a longer time for light to go from end to end
in the moving clock than in the stationary clock. Therefore the apparent
time between clicks is longer for the moving clock, in the same
proportion as shown in the hypotenuse of the triangle (that is the
source of the square root expressions in our equations). From the figure
it is also apparent that the greater uu is, the more slowly the moving
clock appears to run. Not only does this particular kind of clock run
more slowly, but if the theory of relativity is correct, any other
clock, operating on any principle whatsoever, would also appear to run
slower, and in the same proportion—we can say this without further
analysis. Why is this so?
To answer the above question, suppose we had two other clocks made
exactly alike with wheels and gears, or perhaps based on radioactive
decay, or something else. Then we adjust these clocks so they both run
in precise synchronism with our first clocks. When light goes up and
back in the first clocks and announces its arrival with a click, the new
models also complete some sort of cycle, which they simultaneously
announce by some doubly coincident flash, or bong, or other signal. One
of these clocks is taken into the space ship, along with the first kind.
Perhaps this clock will not run slower, but will continue to keep
the same time as its stationary counterpart, and thus disagree with the
other moving clock. Ah no, if that should happen, the man in the ship
could use this mismatch between his two clocks to determine the speed of
his ship, which we have been supposing is impossible. We need not
know anything about the machinery of the new clock that might cause the
effect—we simply know that whatever the reason, it will appear to run
slow, just like the first one.
Now if all moving clocks run slower, if no way of measuring time
gives anything but a slower rate, we shall just have to say, in a
certain sense, that time itself appears to be slower in a space
ship. All the phenomena there—the man’s pulse rate, his thought
processes, the time he takes to light a cigar, how long it takes to grow
up and get old—all these things must be slowed down in the same
proportion, because he cannot tell he is moving. The biologists and
medical men sometimes say it is not quite certain that the time it takes
for a cancer to develop will be longer in a space ship, but from the
viewpoint of a modern physicist it is nearly certain; otherwise one
could use the rate of cancer development to determine the speed of the
ship!
A very interesting example of the slowing of time with motion is
furnished by muons, which are particles that disintegrate
spontaneously after an average lifetime of 2.2×10−62.2×10−6 sec. They
come to the earth in cosmic rays, and can also be produced artificially
in the laboratory. Some of them disintegrate in midair, but the
remainder disintegrate only after they encounter a piece of material and
stop. It is clear that in its short lifetime a muon cannot travel, even
at the speed of light, much more than 600600 meters. But although the
muons are created at the top of the atmosphere, some 1010 kilometers up,
yet they are actually found in a laboratory down here, in cosmic rays.
How can that be? The answer is that different muons move at various
speeds, some of which are very close to the speed of light. While from
their own point of view they live only about 22 μμsec, from our
point of view they live considerably longer—enough longer that they
may reach the earth. The factor by which the time is increased has
already been given as 1/1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√1/1−u2/c2. The average life has been
measured quite accurately for muons of different velocities, and the
values agree closely with the formula.
We do not know why the muon disintegrates or what its machinery is, but
we do know its behavior satisfies the principle of relativity. That is
the utility of the principle of relativity—it permits us to make
predictions, even about things that otherwise we do not know much about.
For example, before we have any idea at all about what makes the muon
disintegrate, we can still predict that when it is moving at nine-tenths
of the speed of light, the apparent length of time that it lasts is
(2.2×10−6)/1−92/102−−−−−−−−−√(2.2×10−6)/1−92/102 sec; and our prediction
works—that is the good thing about it.
15–5The Lorentz contraction
Now let us return to the Lorentz transformation (15.3) and
try to get a better understanding of the relationship between
the (x,y,z,t)(x,y,z,t) and the (x′,y′,z′,t′)(x′,y′,z′,t′) coordinate systems, which we
shall call the SS and S′S′ systems, or Joe and Moe systems,
respectively. We have already noted that the first equation is based on
the Lorentz suggestion of contraction along the xx-direction; how can
we prove that a contraction takes place? In the Michelson-Morley
experiment, we now appreciate that
the transverse arm BCBC cannot change length, by the principle of
relativity; yet the null result of the experiment demands that the
times must be equal. So, in order for the experiment to give a
null result, the longitudinal arm BEBE must appear shorter, by the
square root 1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√1−u2/c2. What does this contraction mean, in
terms of measurements made by Joe and Moe?
Suppose that Moe, moving
with the S′S′ system in the xx-direction, is measuring the
x′x′-coordinate of some point with a meter stick. He lays the stick down
x′x′ times, so he thinks the distance is x′x′ meters. From the viewpoint
of Joe in the SS system, however, Moe is using a foreshortened ruler,
so the “real” distance measured is x′1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√x′1−u2/c2 meters. Then
if the S′S′ system has travelled a distance utut away from the
SS system, the SS observer would say that the same point, measured in
his coordinates, is at a distance x=x′1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√+utx=x′1−u2/c2+ut, or
x′=x−ut1−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√,x′=x−ut1−u2/c2,
which is the first equation of the Lorentz transformation.
15–6Simultaneity
In an analogous way, because of the difference in time scales, the
denominator expression is introduced into the fourth equation of the
Lorentz transformation.
The most interesting term in that equation is
the ux/c2ux/c2 in the numerator, because that is quite new and unexpected.
Now what does that mean? If we look at the situation carefully we see
that events that occur at two separated places at the same time, as seen
by Moe in S′S′, do not happen at the same time as viewed by Joe
in SS.
If one event occurs at point x1x1 at time t0t0 and the other
event at x2x2 and t0t0 (the same time), we find that the two
corresponding times t′1t1′ and t′2t2′ differ by an amount
t′2−t′1=u(x1−x2)/c21−u2/c2−−−−−−−−√.t2′−t1′=u(x1−x2)/c21−u2/c2.
This circumstance is called “failure of simultaneity at a distance,”
and to make the idea a little clearer let us consider the following
experiment.
Suppose that a man moving in a space ship (system S′S′) has placed a
clock at each end of the ship and is interested in making sure that the
two clocks are in synchronism. How can the clocks be synchronized? There
are many ways. One way, involving very little calculation, would be
first to locate exactly the midpoint between the clocks. Then from this
station we send out a light signal which will go both ways at the same
speed and will arrive at both clocks, clearly, at the same time. This
simultaneous arrival of the signals can be used to synchronize the
clocks. Let us then suppose that the man in S′S′ synchronizes his clocks
by this particular method. Let us see whether an observer in system SS
would agree that the two clocks are synchronous. The man in S′S′ has a
right to believe they are, because he does not know that he is moving.
But the man in SS reasons that since the ship is moving forward, the
clock in the front end was running away from the light signal, hence the
light had to go more than halfway in order to catch up; the rear clock,
however, was advancing to meet the light signal, so this distance was
shorter. Therefore the signal reached the rear clock first, although the
man in S′S′ thought that the signals arrived simultaneously. We thus see
that when a man in a space ship thinks the times at two locations are
simultaneous, equal values of t′t′ in his coordinate system must
correspond to different values of tt in the other coordinate
system!
15–7Four-vectors
Let us see what else we can discover in the Lorentz transformation. It
is interesting to note that the transformation between the xx’s
and tt’s is analogous in form to the transformation of the xx’s
and yy’s that we studied in Chapter 11 for a rotation of
coordinates. We then had
x′y′=x=ycosθ+ycosθ−xsinθ,sinθ,(15.8)(15.8)x′=xcos⁡θ+ysin⁡θ,y′=ycos⁡θ−xsin⁡θ,
in which the new x′x′ mixes the old xx and yy, and the new y′y′ also
mixes the old xx and yy; similarly, in the Lorentz transformation we
find a new x′x′ which is a mixture of xx and tt, and a new t′t′ which
is a mixture of tt and xx. So the Lorentz transformation is analogous
to a rotation, only it is a “rotation” in space and time, which
appears to be a strange concept. A check of the analogy to rotation can
be made by calculating the quantity
x′2+y′2+z′2−c2t′2=x2+y2+z2−c2t2.(15.9)(15.9)x′2+y′2+z′2−c2t′2=x2+y2+z2−c2t2.
In this equation the first three terms on each side represent, in
three-dimensional geometry, the square of the distance between a point
and the origin (surface of a sphere) which remains unchanged (invariant)
regardless of rotation of the coordinate axes. Similarly,
Eq. (15.9) shows that there is a certain combination which
includes time, that is invariant to a Lorentz transformation. Thus, the
analogy to a rotation is complete, and is of such a kind that vectors,
i.e., quantities involving “components” which transform the same way
as the coordinates and time, are also useful in connection with
relativity.
Thus we contemplate an extension of the idea of vectors, which we have
so far considered to have only space components, to include a time
component. That is, we expect that there will be vectors with four
components, three of which are like the components of an ordinary
vector, and with these will be associated a fourth component, which is
the analog of the time part.
This concept will be analyzed further in the next chapters, where we
shall find that if the ideas of the preceding paragraph are applied to
momentum, the transformation gives three space parts that are like
ordinary momentum components, and a fourth component, the time part,
which is the energy.
15–8Relativistic dynamics
We are now ready to investigate, more generally, what form the laws of
mechanics take under the Lorentz transformation. [We have thus far
explained how length and time change, but not how we get the modified
formula for mm (Eq. 15.1). We shall do this in the next
chapter.] To see the consequences of Einstein’s modification of mm for Newtonian mechanics, we
start with the Newtonian law that force is the rate of change of
momentum, or
F=d(mv)/dt.F=d(mv)/dt.
Momentum is still given by mvmv, but when we use the new mm this becomes
p=mv=m0v1−v2/c2−−−−−−−−√.(15.10)(15.10)p=mv=m0v1−v2/c2.
This is Einstein’s modification of Newton’s
laws. Under this modification, if action
and reaction are still equal (which they may not be in detail, but are
in the long run), there will be conservation of momentum in the same way
as before, but the quantity that is being conserved is not the
old mvmv with its constant mass, but instead is the quantity shown
in (15.10), which has the modified mass. When this change is
made in the formula for momentum, conservation of momentum still works.
Now let us see how momentum varies with speed. In Newtonian mechanics it
is proportional to the speed and, according to (15.10), over a
considerable range of speed, but small compared with cc, it is nearly
the same in relativistic mechanics, because the square-root expression
differs only slightly from 11. But when vv is almost equal to cc, the
square-root expression approaches zero, and the momentum therefore goes
toward infinity.
What happens if a constant force acts on a body for a long time? In
Newtonian mechanics the body keeps picking up speed until it goes faster
than light. But this is impossible in relativistic mechanics. In
relativity, the body keeps picking up, not speed, but momentum, which
can continually increase because the mass is increasing. After a while
there is practically no acceleration in the sense of a change of
velocity, but the momentum continues to increase. Of course, whenever a
force produces very little change in the velocity of a body, we say that
the body has a great deal of inertia, and that is exactly what our
formula for relativistic mass says (see Eq. 15.10)—it says
that the inertia is very great when vv is nearly as great as cc. As an
example of this effect, to deflect the high-speed electrons in the
synchrotron that is used here at Caltech, we need a
magnetic field that is 20002000 times stronger than would be expected on
the basis of Newton’s laws. In other
words, the mass of the electrons in the synchrotron
is 20002000 times as great as their normal mass, and is as great as that
of a proton! That mm should be 20002000 times m0m0 means that 1−v2/c21−v2/c2 must be 1/4,000,0001/4,000,000, and that means that vv differs from
cc by one part in 8,000,0008,000,000, so the electrons are getting pretty
close to the speed of light. If the electrons and light were both to
start from the synchrotron (estimated as 700700 feet
away) and rush out to Bridge Lab, which would arrive first? The light,
of course, because light always travels faster.1 How much
earlier? That is too hard to tell—instead, we tell by what distance
the light is ahead: it is about 1/10001/1000 of an inch, or
1414 the thickness of a piece of paper!
When the electrons
are going that fast their masses are enormous, but their speed cannot
exceed the speed of light.
Now let us look at some further consequences of relativistic change of
mass. Consider the motion of the molecules in a small tank of gas. When
the gas is heated, the speed of the molecules is increased, and
therefore the mass is also increased and the gas is heavier. An
approximate formula to express the increase of mass, for the case when
the velocity is small, can be found by expanding m0/1−v2/c2−−−−−−−−√=m0(1−v2/c2)−1/2m0/1−v2/c2=m0(1−v2/c2)−1/2 in a power series, using the binomial
theorem. We get
m0(1−v2/c2)−1/2=m0(1+12v2/c2+38v4/c4+⋯).m0(1−v2/c2)−1/2=m0(1+12v2/c2+38v4/c4+⋯).
We see clearly from the formula that the series converges rapidly when
vv is small, and the terms after the first two or three are negligible.
So we can write
m≅m0+12m0v2(1c2)(15.11)(15.11)m≅m0+12m0v2(1c2)
in which the second term on the right expresses the increase of mass due
to molecular velocity. When the temperature increases the v2v2
increases proportionately, so we can say that the increase in mass is
proportional to the increase in temperature. But
since 12m0v212m0v2 is the kinetic energy in the old-fashioned
Newtonian sense, we can also say that the increase in mass of all this
body of gas is equal to the increase in kinetic energy divided by c2c2,
or Δm=Δ(K.E.)/c2Δm=Δ(K.E.)/c2.
15–9Equivalence of mass and energy
The above observation led Einstein to the suggestion that the mass of a body can be expressed
more simply than by the formula (15.1), if we say that the
mass is equal to the total energy content divided by c2c2. If
Eq. (15.11) is multiplied by c2c2 the result is
mc2=m0c2+12m0v2+⋯(15.12)(15.12)mc2=m0c2+12m0v2+⋯
Here, the term on the left expresses the total energy of a body, and we
recognize the last term as the ordinary kinetic energy.
Einstein interpreted the large
constant term, m0c2m0c2, to be part of the total energy of the body, an
intrinsic energy known as the “rest energy.”
Let us follow out the consequences of assuming, with
Einstein, that the energy
of a body always equals mc2mc2. As an interesting result, we shall find
the formula (15.1) for the variation of mass with speed,
which we have merely assumed up to now. We start with the body at rest,
when its energy is m0c2m0c2. Then we apply a force to the body, which
starts it moving and gives it kinetic energy; therefore, since the
energy has increased, the mass has increased—this is implicit in the
original assumption. So long as the force continues, the energy and the
mass both continue to increase. We have already seen
(Chapter 13) that the rate of change of energy with time
equals the force times the velocity, or
dEdt=F⋅v.(15.13)(15.13)dEdt=F⋅v.
We also have (Chapter 9, Eq. 9.1) that F=d(mv)/dtF=d(mv)/dt. When these relations are put together with the definition
of EE, Eq. (15.13) becomes
d(mc2)dt=v⋅d(mv)dt.(15.14)(15.14)d(mc2)dt=v⋅d(mv)dt.
We wish to solve this equation for mm. To do this we first use the
mathematical trick of multiplying both sides by 2m2m, which changes the
equation to
c2(2m)dmdt=2mv⋅d(mv)dt.(15.15)(15.15)c2(2m)dmdt=2mv⋅d(mv)dt.
We need to get rid of the derivatives, which can be accomplished by
integrating both sides. The quantity (2m)dm/dt(2m)dm/dt can be recognized as
the time derivative of m2m2, and (2mv)⋅d(mv)/dt(2mv)⋅d(mv)/dt is the
time derivative of (mv)2(mv)2. So, Eq. (15.15) is the same as
c2d(m2)dt=d(m2v2)dt.(15.16)(15.16)c2d(m2)dt=d(m2v2)dt.
If the derivatives of two quantities are equal, the quantities
themselves differ at most by a constant, say CC. This permits us to
write
m2c2=m2v2+C.(15.17)(15.17)m2c2=m2v2+C.
We need to define the constant CC more explicitly. Since
Eq. (15.17) must be true for all velocities, we can choose a
special case where v=0v=0, and say that in this case the mass is m0m0.
Substituting these values into Eq. (15.17) gives
m20c2=0+C.m02c2=0+C.
We can now use this value of CC in Eq. (15.17), which
becomes
m2c2=m2v2+m20c2.(15.18)(15.18)m2c2=m2v2+m02c2.
Dividing by c2c2 and rearranging terms gives
m2(1−v2/c2)=m20,m2(1−v2/c2)=m02,
from which we get
m=m0/1−v2/c2−−−−−−−−√.(15.19)(15.19)m=m0/1−v2/c2.
This is the formula (15.1), and is exactly what is necessary
for the agreement between mass and energy in Eq. (15.12).
Ordinarily these energy changes represent extremely slight changes in
mass, because most of the time we cannot generate much energy from a
given amount of material; but in an atomic bomb of explosive energy
equivalent to 2020 kilotons of TNT, for example, it can be shown that
the dirt after the explosion is lighter by 11 gram than the initial
mass of the reacting material, because of the energy that was released,
i.e., the released energy had a mass of 11 gram, according to the
relationship ΔE=Δ(mc2)ΔE=Δ(mc2). This theory of equivalence of mass
and energy has been beautifully verified by experiments in which matter
is annihilated—converted totally to energy: An electron and a positron
come together at rest, each with a rest mass m0m0. When they come
together they disintegrate and two gamma rays emerge, each with the
measured energy of m0c2m0c2. This experiment furnishes a direct
determination of the energy associated with the existence of the rest
mass of a particle.
The electrons
would actually win the race versus visible light because of the
index of refraction of air. A gamma ray would make out better.
